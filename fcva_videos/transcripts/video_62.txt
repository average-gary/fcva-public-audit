The consent agenda is adopted as presented.
Board of Supervisors, comments are there any?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman McCart.
I have three items of like to comment on.
The first is that earlier today I tended the grand opening of the new Albin Convenience Center
and Albin in the Gainesboro district.
It's where the dump quote unquote where you can take your trash opens first thing
tomorrow morning at 7 a.m.
It's a beautiful facility.
It came in on time and way under budget.
Which is no small measure considering some of the challenges that our public work
department has to deal with.
So once again, I just want to thank our public works director Joe Wilder and all of his staff
for the wonderful work they do for the people of Freda County.
And it's a huge new benefit to the folks at Gainesboro.
I have two other incidents that occurred in the last couple of weeks that I wanted to comment on.
I'm going to read these just because they're somewhat complicated.
Really?
The first was an incident reported in the Winchester Star on September 9th.
Reporting on the fact of Virginia's new red flag law, red flag law has been enforced
against the citizen of this county by the Freda County Sheriff's Office on September 2nd.
Under this red flag law, a citizen's guns, his property was seized from him and taken by agents
of the county government without due process of law based solely on statements of two individuals.
Two weeks later, that citizen appeared in court and as reported in the Winchester Star on September
12, 2020, Judge Alex Hayden determined that there was not enough evidence to consider the accused
to be a substantial risk in order to determine that any crime had been committed.
And it was ordered that his property, his legally owned firearms, be returned to him.
Again, a citizen of the United States, a citizen of the Commonwealth of Virginia,
he was supposed to have the protection of our federal and state constitutions had his legally
owned firearms forcibly seized and taken from him without the due process of law.
Some have warned that because this law was passed as a gun control measure by the state legislature,
that a violation of the second amendment of the constitution, but I would point out that not only
does it likely violate the second amendment, but it also certainly violates the 14th amendment
of a constitution which states, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law. It may likely also violate the fourth amendment of the constitution,
the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, no warrants issue, but upon probable cause.
And typically the probable cause of a crime being committed, legally owning or possessing a
firearm is not a crime, nor is legally possessing a firearm in and of itself evidence of a crime.
I warned last November, and I'll say it again, this law flies in the face of our constitutional rights,
and I am beyond concerned that our sheriff or Commonwealth's attorney would feel compelled to see
the citizen's firearms simply on the say so of another individual. It would appear that we
are living in very dangerous times, a time when what was once considered constitutionally protected
is no longer protected. At a time when the government can kick down our doors and
demand our property whether or not a jury of our peers has determined that we are guilty of any crime.
When our government at the point of a gun can disarm a law abiding citizen, take away his firearms
and enforce him to expend his money on attorneys and legal costs to prove his innocence rather than
require that the government prove his guilt. I implore the citizens of this county every and every
other locality in Virginia to stand up and make yourselves heard in Richmond. Let them know that we
will not abide a government that tramples our God-given rights, our constitutionally protected
rights, we will not abide a government that will disarm its citizens and make us subjects of the
government. Mr. Chairman, the second occurrence that occurred just last week that I'd like to
shed light on is no less troubling to me than the first occurrence that I just mentioned. It's
yet another failure of government to safeguard citizens. Last Tuesday night at the Frederick County
School Board meeting, a motion was made to spend approximately $1.9 million from unexpended funds
on the purchase of new school buses. Now, I take no position on whether buying school buses
is a good expenditure or not. That is not the point of my comments tonight. I bring this incident
up to Sean Light on the conversation that ensued as part of the discussion surrounding the
proposed motion to purchase the buses. School Board Member Brandon Monk pointed out to his
fellow board members that he had been given no forewarning prior to the motion being made,
that there would be a motion to appropriate nearly $2 million. In other words, he had not been
given the time to review whether or not the 19 buses was or was not a prudent expenditure of
the school's funds. He wisely, in my opinion, confirmed with a school staff that a decision was
not required immediately and simply asked the decision to be tabled until the next school board
meeting, so that other school board members would have time to consider the request and make
an informed decision on whether or not to approve the $2 million expenditure. Immediately after
school board member Monk made his request, school board member Michael Lake, who happens to be the
elected official from my district, Gainesborough district, interjected to school Mr. Monk and the two
other new members of the school board on what the school board member's job is and what it is not.
In the process of schooling Mr. Monk and the two other new board members, Mr. Lake made it clear
that they should not be asking questions about the budget or trying to determine spending
priorities. Mr. Lake explained it this way and I quote, we, meaning the school board, are a
consumer of information from the school system and we are a policy board and what we need to keep an
eye on is policy is policy being followed and is the school system following a good decent business
practice. Mr. Lake said, I can tell you this is my ninth year and we do not do the weed stuff and
we are consumers of information from the staff. We judge doesn't meet the policy requirement is a good
business practice. He continued. But the bottom line is we don't adjust the figures. We do not run
the school division. That is their business. Dr. Sovine and his staff's business and we keep to our
policies. He then continued. So in that regard, if we were to delay this vote, come back and think
of other categories, it's theirs to decide. Dr. Sovine to decide whether to buy the 19 buses.
We're probably not going to change that. He said, we don't know enough about all the categories of
the budget book that's probably this thick where money may or may not be spent. We can't sit around
and think of a few or we, I'm sorry, we can sit around and think of a few, but it's really not our
job. Really not our job to know where the money may or may not be spent. Really not our job to
consider the budget and make decisions on spending priorities. Again, I quote Mr. Lake, this is my
ninth year. We don't know enough about all the categories of the budget book where the money may
or may not be spent. It's not our job. Well, let me take a moment to point out something to Mr.
Lake and to any other confused member of our school board for the benefit of the taxpayers of
Frederick County. The Virginia code states the following, section 22.1-89 management of funds.
Each school board shall manage and control. The funds made available to the school board for
public schools, shall manage and control. That means that not only is it the job of the school board,
it is a legal duty of the school board to manage and control the funds under their care.
To do otherwise, it would be misfeasants and office at best and possibly malfeasants. Does anyone
here not recall the recent aboccal and worn county where tens of millions of dollars were misspent
because the elected officials failed to properly oversee the expenditures? For at least two
years now, multiple members of this board have requested from the school division a detailed budget
so that we can see where the school's money is being spent and the schools have failed to provide
such information to us. Members of the school board, who the few who have made a real effort to
carry out their state mandated duty, have requested the same information from their employees,
the administrators of the school division, and they too are stonewalled and do not receive the
information. It's no wonder, Mr. Lake, that as you say you don't know enough about all the
categories of the budget book where the money may or not be spent. If for nine years since you've
been on the school board, neither you nor your fellow members have seen the details of where the
money is going. The citizens, the taxpayers of this county, deserve to know where the funds are
being spent. The teachers, the cafeteria workers, the janitors, the bus drivers deserve to know how
the funds are being spent. On behalf of the citizens of the Gainesborough district, as a member of
this body who likewise has a fiduciary duty to know that the school's funds are properly being
overseen by elected officials, I demand swift action from the school board to make the school's
budget public and that they take up their duty of reviewing, managing, and controlling those funds
until such time as that has taken place. I for one cannot perform my duty as a fiduciary on
behalf of the taxpayers of Frederick County, and I will not vote to appropriate any further funds
to a school system until we know that your school board is carrying out its fiduciary duty.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir. Anyone else? Mr. Chairman? Yes, sir. Supervisor Graber.
I wasn't planning to speak on this this evening as I was waiting as I have a foyer's request
into the school system. I would like to second everything in which my fellow supervisors just stated.
In March, we closed the schools due to COVID. In April, I started to ask where those funds would
be spent due to the closures so that we could assure that our students have school buildings that
are safe, livable, and healthy for them to attend as I've had multiple teachers approach me,
stating that the school buildings weren't disrepair and were not being repaired for extended periods
of time. I ask in April, I ask in May, with my school board representative, Mr. Marclam,
extremely proud of being a hound to try to get the information for me. I'm out with the chairman
of the school boards in May to also ask for information on where has the funding gone since the
schools have been closed? What repairs have been made? I ask in June, I ask in July, I've asked in
August, and I'm still waiting. On Saturday, I filed a foyer's request, formally asking for some
information, specifically regarding the last meeting in which supervisor McCarthy speaks.
I too have been on the receiving end of a tongue lashing from school board member Lake,
regarding my quote unquote, unknown abilities or inability to understand what they do.
It is very discouraging to me, and in fact, I believe it's reprehensible, that we have members
of the school board who are not managing the funds of you, the taxpayer, you and I, the taxpayer,
when those funds are so hard to come by, especially in the environment which we were in.
Thank you, Mr. McCarthy, for bringing it to light. It is my hope in the not-too-distant future that
I will have a video with audio to show this board and all of the citizens of this county what
truly transpired on Tuesday night of week. Thank you. Thank you. Any other comments, anyone?
Mr. Carvin. Yes, sir. I just, I just, I just, I just, I don't think your microphone,
so on, Blake. There he is. There he goes. Sorry, a little closer. So I just, I just,
I just, I just had myself with Mr. McCarthy's comments on red flags. As for the schools,
we'll have a video show responsibility, so we'll work on that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir.
Anyone else? All right. Move on. Committee appointments. Parks and Rec.
Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. I would like to move for reappointment of
just Morrison to the Parks and Recreation Commission from the Shawnee District. Second.
Second. Any discussion? Anyone? All those in favor, aye? Aye.
Opposed, no. Mr. Morrison will be reappointed. That will bring us to committee business,
Code and Ordnance Committee. Someone, Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir.
Mr. McCarthy. I would move that we adopt the proposal from the Code
Ordnance Committee, which would repeal section 155- I'm sorry, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm 90,
9A, I would move that we accept the proposal from the Code and Ordnance Committee
to approve section 155- 118, or 18.1 to designate the roads and streets within,
like Frederick Shenandoah subdivision as highways for law enforcement purposes.
Erdemotion is our second. Second. And a second. Discussion? Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir.
You would need to hold a public hearing in order to do that, but
we're following the motion might be daring to hold a public hearing. I'm in, I'm in my motion,
Mr. Chairman, to recommend that we hold a public hearing at the next board meeting or the next
soonest possible date in order to take up whether or not to adopt this ordinance.
I'll second it. And a second to the amended motion. Second. Okay, thanks, sir.
Now, discussion. Hearing none. All those in favor, aye.
Aye. Aye. Opposed, no. We'll forward that one to public hearing at the first opportunity.
9Bs, proposed revisions to county code. We provide them a car. Mr. Chairman, I would move that we
forward this proposal to public hearing for the proposed revision of our county code chapter 86 regarding
festivals. Erdemotion is our second. Second. Second.
Just a proposal to replace it with something else. I don't believe so, Mr. Chairman. I believe
it's just a straight repeal. Okay. Okay. Any other discussion, anyone?
Forward to public hearing? Is that correct? All right. All those in favor, aye.
Aye. Opposed, no. We'll forward that one to public hearing as well at the first opportunity.
Finance committee. Supervisor slaughter. Mr. Chairman, the finance committee met on September
the 16th at 8 a.m. Items number three and four were approved under consent agenda and I would
so move. Erdemotion, is there a second? Second. Second. Second. Is there any discussion?
Supervisor Graver? Aye. Supervisor Dunn? Aye. Supervisor Well? Aye. Supervisor slaughter? Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy? Supervisor Fisher? Aye. Chair votes aye and the motion carries.
Item number one, the Sheriff's Request to General Fund Supplemental Appropriation in the
amount of $20,559.80. This amount represents the sale of surplus and will be used toward the
purchase of a new cruiser, $13,409.23, and a building at the impound, $7,150.57, no local funds
required. The committee recommends approval and I would so move. Second.
Motion in a second. Is there any discussion? Anyone? Supervisor Fisher? Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy? Aye. Supervisor slaughter?
Aye. Supervisor Well? Aye. Supervisor Dunn? Aye.
Supervisor Graver? Aye. Chair votes aye and the motion carries.
Item number two, the Sheriff's Request to General Fund Supplemental Appropriation in the amount of
$45,020.68 to purchase a building for the impound lot. Of this amount, $5,000 is a donation
received and $40,020.68 is a carry forward of unspent insurance proceeds from damage to
a tent in 2018. The committee recommends approval and I would so move.
Second. Motion in a second. Is there any discussion? Anyone?
Supervisor Graver? Aye. Supervisor Dunn? Aye. Supervisor Well?
Aye. Supervisor slaughter? Aye. Supervisor McCarthy? Aye.
Supervisor Fisher? Aye. Chair votes aye and the motion carries.
Item number five, the Finance Director presented fiscal year 2020 year-end financial
information and request a public hearing for a general fund and county capital fund Supplemental
Appropriation in the amount of $9,800,000. This amount represents general fund fund balance in
excess of 20% to be transferred to the capital fund. The committee recommends advertising for
a public hearing and I would so move. Second. Motion in a second. Is there any discussion?
All those in favor? Aye. Aye. Opposed? No. We'll forward that when the public hearing at the
first opportunity. That concludes my report, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Chairman? Yes, sir.
So on the finance issue earlier today, I'd send out an email to everybody and on Monday,
I had a meeting with the volunteer fire and rescue liaison. One of the items that was proposed
for this year's budget was the $190,000 which was including the $2.8 million that was held in
the bans to seeing where we were on finance. At a conversation with Mr. Paternity earlier today,
end-shell Sheffler, finance director on Friday, and they believe that they have the money to cover
that. So therefore, I'm not asking for a vote. I'm just asking for on behalf of the administrator
whether there's a consensus that releasing that money as budgeted for a volunteer fire and rescue
would be an appropriate thing. I think it's important because they've been unable to go and raise
money through a number of items because of COVID. So I'm putting that on the table for a discussion
as you see that. We have been discussing that one very frequently recently. Mr. Chairman,
for one public, I would support that, and if there were others that would do that,
and let Mr. Tierney know, then I think that would help Mr. Tierney from what I understand.
Okay. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Come in,
anyone? Mr. Chairman, I would support such an expenditure.
Yes. Okay. Mr. Chairman, I would like last.
All right. Everyone. Mr. Chairman, as you know, because you are a member of the finance committee.
We did take up this discussion at finance, and it was the majority of the committee
thought that was appropriate, and that Mr. Tierney would proceed forward with that cautiously.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all.
I'm in, is anyone? Okay. Let's move on.
Planning Commission business, public hearings, and we are now at 12A, which was previously 12B.
Conditional use permit, 1020. Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.
This is a conditional use permit for public guards with no body repair,
for vehicles and form equipment, for property located on 5, 1, 1, 5, city creek grade.
Again, this property is zoned RA, and the current land use is a residential and agricultural and
surrounding properties are also zoned RA, and have residential and agricultural land uses.
The zoning ward is defined as a public garage for use for servicing and repairing of equipment
and of motor vehicles. This applicant proposed to have one employee with the use. The use will
take place entirely and enclosed building on site and access to the properties provided by a
private driveway from city creek grade, Route 622. If I can turn your attention to the map,
I'm not lying to you. Again, it's surrounded by RA property and it's active form right now.
What the applicant is looking to do, Mr. Chairman, is work on former equipment initially,
but also wants ability to, if there's any expansion to do automobiles. Also, now, as you
will aware of the conditional use permit would have to be changed, that would have to be brought
on this board for any additions to it, so we're trying to encapsulate for any future growth for
this applicant. There's a layout, basically, where he's going to work again. It's a garage,
born, it's out there on the property right now, and where they're going to operate out of.
Should the board find this pro, this used to be appropriate, is to plan the commission,
recommend the following conditions, be assigned to this conditional use permit.
We're on our review agency comments, requirements to comply with it all times.
Number two, an illustrative sketch plan should be submitted to and approved by Frederick County
of Home Improvement, it's completed prior to established for the use. Number five, all auto repair
related activities will occur entirely within an enclosed structure, no more than five vehicles
waiting for repair on site any given time, and any external storage of parts or equipment,
shall be screened from view by a opaque fence or screen, at least six foot height and height.
Number four, the eyes of operation shall be from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday,
and 8 a.m. to do it on Saturdays and closed on Sundays. Number five,
to propose business, signs to conform to college occupations, sign requirements,
shall not exceed four square feet in size, and five feet in height. And number six,
any expansion or change of use of this use will require a new conditional use permit.
Mr. Chairman, the applicant is here to answer any questions that the Board may have on this
proposed conditional use permit, and following the public hearing staff is seeking a decision for
the Board's supervisor. Thank you. Questions of Mr. Chair and anyone? Anyone?
Questions of the applicant, any more?
All right. How would the Board like to handle this one? This is a public hearing?
I'm sorry? Public hearing. Public hearing? Yes. Yeah, we're getting there.
Says a public hearing, would anyone like to comment concerning this proposed conditional use permit?
Anyone at all? Anyone? Seeing no one will close the public comment portion.
I would the Board like to handle this one. Mr. Chairman? Yes, sir.
It is in the back of the district, so I would like to make a motion on this.
In looking and reviewing this, I see it to be an appropriate use of the facility as designed
and presented. So I will make a motion that we approve conditional use permit, number 10-20
for Hans Halsus. The motion is our second. Second. Is there any discussion?
Hearing none? Supervisor Graver? Aye. Supervisor Dunn? Aye. Supervisor Wells? Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter? Aye. Supervisor McCarthy? Supervisor Fisher? Aye. Chair votes aye.
The motion carries and the conditional use permit is approved. That will bring us to the former
12-A, which is, I mean 12-B, which is now 12-A. Mr. Collette? Yes. Good evening, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the Board of Supervisors, this is conditional use permit 05-20, the Barton-Zoe
Energy LLC Utility Scale Solar Power Generating Facility. The properties are generally located
along passage road, marble road, middle road, springdale road, west of the railroad corridor,
and partially within the town of Stephen City limits. This is within the, partially within the
OPECAN, ministerial district, and within the Bat Creek, ministerial district. It is identified
with the following pin numbers, and I will also include that it's all lots, one through 12,
springdale Glen, and lots one through 52 of Carleton estates. The property is presently zoned
R-A rural areas, and the current land use is agricultural and vacant, and the proposed use,
again, is a utility-scale solar power generating facility. Again, directing your attention to the
screen, the subject properties are outlined in blue for context, middle road is here, springdale road,
bisects the property through the middle, the town of Stephen City is highlighted in purple,
and the railroad corridor runs north to south through here, and we'll go into more detail about
the site as we go along in the presentation. This board will recall that this body added utility
scale solar power generating facilities as a conditional use in the R-A zoning district,
and with that use, we included supplemental use regulations for public utilities that pertain to
utility-scale solar facilities, and this was added to the zoning ordinance in January of this
year, and that for intensive purposes is our solar ordinance, and we'll highlight some of the
aspects of that as we go through the application. The project will generate 80 to 130 megawatts
of photovoltaic or solar energy. Of the total 1,160 acres, 705 acres will be utilized for the
installation of rows of ground-mounted photovoltaic modules, commonly known as solar panels,
on other necessary equipment for facility operations, including a substation and inverters,
vehicle access paths, security fencing, and landscaping. Power generated by this facility will be
combined, converted and increased, to allow delivery to the adjacent first energy, 138 kilovolt
transmission line. A portion of this project, or approximately 132 acres, is within the
corporate limits of the town of Steven City. The portion of the project in the town is subject
to the regulations of the town, and solar is a by-right use within the town of Steven City,
so that the portion that is in the town is subject to a separate review by the town for the proposed
use. Again, it's provided as part of this application for context, but that 132 acres
is subject to the requirements of the town, and not subject to the regulations of Frederick County.
In addition, 64 platted residential lots in the county, inclusive of Springdale Glen and
Carlton estate subdivisions, will be vacated as part of this project, in addition to the
vacation of the dedicated right away for public streets. In regards to our comprehensive plan,
the 2035 Comprehensive Plan envisions this area of the county to remain primarily rural in
nature, and for agricultural land to be preserved for future generations. The project is generally
compatible with the comprehensive plan, with the rural character of the area, and with the adjoining
agricultural and residential land uses. The preservation of the underlying land maintains the
ability for agricultural uses in the future. The use, utility-scale solar, once an operation is
highly passive, it does not generate noise, odor, glare, or traffic, and is proposed to be
extensively screened from view, minimizing adverse effects on surrounding properties.
In regards to the zoning ordinance requirements for utility-scale solar,
public utilities, including these types of facilities, are specifies that the zoning
administrator has the authority to determine the setback for those lots. Setbacks for solar
arrays or panels will conform to the setback requirements contained in the zoning ordinance
for principle uses in the R.A. rural area zoning district. You all were recalled that this is
the same determination that the zoning administrator made into the other solar project that you
all considered over the summer, the Foxcloth project. In addition to the zoning ordinance requirements
for setbacks, we require site plan review and approval under Article 8 of the zoning ordinance.
A concept plan revised on August the 28th was submitted with the application. In that
concept plan, the applicant proposes setbacks of 100 feet and 200 feet around the perimeter of the
project. Again, those setbacks are in excess of the setbacks for principle uses as dictated by
the zoning or zoning administrator determination. Landscaping and screening will also be provided
throughout the project and are highlighted as a landscape buffer on concept plan sheets 3 and 4,
which I'll highlight in a subsequent slide. Further, access to the site is proposed from two
entrances on Springdale Road and one entrance from Passage Road. Again, those entrances are
clearly depicted on the concept plan sheets 3 and 4. If I can direct your attention to the screen,
this is the revised concept plan. On sheet 3 is the Northern portion of the project, which is
primarily within Frederick County. context Springdale Road runs through the middle of the site
and north and south of Springdale Road, which is formerly Springdale Glen and portions of the
SNAP property will be containing solar panels and south of Springdale Road is the formal
Carlton Estates subdivision, which was 52 lots, which will also be solar panels. You can see on
the concept plan, the landscape details that includes extensive buffers and screening and the
preservation of woodlands to minimize the view of the panels. Directing your attention to the
screen, this is the Southern portion of the project, South of Springdale Road, along Passage Road,
and this portion of the project here, roughly 200 acres, is within the town of Steven City.
Again, it's provided on the concept plan for context about the larger project, but it's not subject
to Frederick County regulations, but I will know that the applicant and working with the neighbors
has provided extensive buffers and screening, including an earthen berm to address some of the
view shit concerns that were raised in their meetings with the public. I'll also note that these
parcels that are highlighted in yellow are within the Frederick County's jurisdiction,
and they are shown on the concept plan as interconnection parcels. There will be no solar panels on
these, but they are immediately adjacent to the railroad facility, and that's where the
transmission lines were in north to south, and the applicant is proposing a
substation right up against the railroad and the existing overhead transmission facilities.
The zoning ordinance also requires that as part of an application for utility-scale solar
or decommissioning plan is provided, and a decommissioning plan was submitted with this application.
Decommissioning provides for provisions for the removal of all equipment and the restoration
of the site to the pre-development condition, so that would be vacant agricultural land,
and as part of the decommissioning plan, it specifies entering into a written agreement and
financial security with Frederick County for the life of the project and conformance with the
requirements of the zoning ordinance in the code of Virginia, and the estimated cost for decommissioning
as part of this plan are reviewed and updated every five years. That's just the cover of the
decommissioning plan known as Exhibit D. In addition to Frederick County's review of the
conditional use permit, the applicant will also be pursuing a permit by rule or PBR through the
Virginia Department of Environmental Quality. PBR is a state-administrated review and approval process,
which includes extensive environmental and cultural review and study. One component of the
state required PBR review is local jurisdiction approval of solar projects citing, and this
conditional use permit application, if approved by the Frederick County Board of Supervisors,
would satisfy the requirement, enabling the completion of the administrative PBR process for
this project. Should the Board of Supervisors find this used to be appropriate, the planning
commission has recommended the following conditions of approval, that all review agency comments
provided during the review of the application shall be complied with at all times,
that an engineered site plan in accordance with requirements of article eight of the zoning
ordinance shall be submitted to and subject to approval by Frederick County prior to the establishment
of the use, and that the site plan shall address the additional regulations for specific uses
outlined in section 165, 204, 26 of the Frederick County zoning ordinance, and be in general
conformance with the concept plan included with the CUP application prepared by Greenway Engineering
dated August 28, 2020. Number three, the buffers and screening shall be provided around the perimeter
of the project, and general conformance with the quantity of the proposed plantings depicted on
sheets three and four of the concept plan, landscape buffer A, B, C, D, E, and F,
included with the CUP application prepared by Greenway Engineering dated August 28, 2020,
and that the landscape buffer planting shall maintained in good health for the life of the project.
Number four, that prior to site plan approval, the owner shall enter into a written agreement
with Frederick County to decommission solar energy equipment facilities or devices
personant to the terms and conditions of section 15.2-2241.2B of the code of Virginia,
and that the written agreement shall be updated every five years in general conformance
with exhibit D, the preliminary decommissioning plan included with the CUP application prepared
by Torch Clean Energy dated May 2020. Number five, the batteries for the purposes of mass storage
of electricity that will eventually be transferred to the grid are prohibited as part of this CUP.
Number six, that this conditional use permit shall not be effective until, unless and until,
the vacations of the Springdale Glen and Carlton Espates subdivisions are approved and recorded.
In addition, the approval and recordation of such vacations shall take place prior to the
approval of any site plan for the use authorized by this conditional use permit.
Number seven, that access to the site shall be limited to two entrances from Springdale Road,
and one entrance from passage road and being general conformance with the concept plan
included with the application prepared by Greenway Engineering dated August 28, 2020.
And the delivery of solar array panel construction materials will occur at site access entrance
of passage road identified as deer lane on sheet four of the concept plan. Solar array
panel material delivery lay down area will be limited to tax parcel 74-A-44A known as the Carball
Property. Number eight, that pile driving of poles for solar arrays during construction shall
be limited to 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and that all other construction activities are
permitted 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday and 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays. No construction
activities are permitted on Sundays. Number nine, that the location of the inverters serving the
solar project shall be at least 450 feet from all adjacent residences. Number 10, that subdivision
for residential development of tax parcels 74-A-3, 74-A-4, 74-A-6C, or of the area currently
constituting the Springdale Glen and Carlton state subdivisions shall be prohibited during such
time as solar power generating equipment is installed on said parcels. And number 11, that any
expansion or modification of this land use will require the approval of a new conditional use permit.
The planning commission held a public hearing on September the second and recommended
approval of the conditional use permit. Following the public hearing this evening, staff is seeking
action by the board of supervisors on this proposed CUP for a utility scale solar power generating
facility. And that any recommendation for approval should also include a statement affirming
the proposed solar facility is in substantial accord with the comprehensive plan.
Staff is happy to answer any questions you have this evening. And Mr. Evan Wyatt is here on
behalf of Greenway and Torch Clean Energy. And I believe he has a few remarks as well. Thank you.
Questions of Mr. Clark. Mr. Chair. Mr. Clark, I have a question regarding conditional use permit
condition number 10 if you would put it up on the screen again. Just for clarification, after
this solar panel were to be decommissioned, would the two subdivisions be allowed to be entered
into as far as to be developed again at that point? Is that what this is saying? The condition
number 10 was an added condition from the planning commission public hearing that would prohibit any
excess land that was part of the project that wasn't being used for solar panels to be subdivided
during this when solar panels were on the properties. It would not preclude the owner at such
time that the facilities decommissioned from applying for a new subdivision, but at such time
Springdale Glen and Carlton states would not suddenly reappear. Once they are vacated, they are
gone and they would have to apply for a new subdivision at such time that it was vacated again.
Thanks for the clarification. Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir.
Mr. Klein, just to follow up on the question of supervisor Graber, I see that they're vacating
64 existing rural reservoir, rural lots. If they were to subdivide all of this land,
do you have any idea what the total subdivided lots would be? How many houses could be built on this
property? Were it all subdivided? The furt of Mr. Chair, he's the subdivision administrator.
All park.
Your destiny is all aware of the course of one of your figures.
The term is out there in the rural areas. It's drain fields, environmental features.
It would be quite a few locks out there right now, so.
Well, we're talking hundreds of lots. Yes, sir.
Thanks for the possibility, sir.
And then I follow up one more question. You'd mentioned that this facility would not produce any
type of glare or wouldn't any major glare. Is that because these panels are engineered in such a way
that they don't produce glare as far as coming from the sun or do you not know the answer to that
question? They're engineered in such a way that they do not produce glare or heat during operation.
Very good. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. President, I have two questions, sir. One is on the transmission lines from the solar panels
to the station. I understand that they are meant to be all underground. No ifs, no aunts, no buts.
Is that correct? Correct. The interconnection of the solar panels to the substation would be
underground. That is a requirement on all of our site plans that all utilities are underground.
But from the substation to the overhead transmission, they would obviously be in above ground
connection. Those are existing above ground connections though now, correct?
Correct. You are correct, yes, sir. Second item is on the decommissioning,
the company is putting up bond money, real cash for the decommissioning and that cash is meant
to be adjusted every five years. So even if the company itself went broke, the money still would be
there to go and take care of the decommissioning. Is that accurate? Yes, sir, that is a correct
statement. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Any other questions, Mr. Claude? Thank you, sir.
Mr. Wyatt? Anything you'd like to add, sir?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. Can you hear me okay?
Okay, thank you. I'm Evan Wyatt with Greenway Engineering, we're representing the
CEP application. I also have with me this evening from Torch, Sam Gulland, who's been working
on the project extensively throughout the entirety of the CUP process.
We thought it might be helpful to go through a very brief presentation and allow Sam to give you
a little bit of information on Torch, who they are, what they're doing. I'll fill in a couple
items on the concept plan and then Sam will conclude. So, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.
Thanks for the opportunity to speak tonight. My name is Sam Gulland. I'm a development manager.
I'm a development manager with Torch Clean Energy. To give you a brief background on my company,
Torch is a developer and owner of solar and wind projects in different parts of the US.
We were founded in 2008. Originally, we were part of an oil and gas company called Torch Energy
Advisors down in Texas. Originally, we worked on wind projects in the Southwest US,
but we've expanded geographically. We've also gotten into solar. Pretty much all of my focus
is on projects that we are developing in Virginia and West Virginia. So, we have working on
several projects. We have permitted a few in Virginia that will enter construction next year.
So, we have one in Chesterfield County near Richmond,
one down in Greensville County near North Carolina. I grew up in Virginia. I'm from Loudon County.
I was in the military for a few years and I love to be back in the state and work in different
parts of the state on these projects. So, I'm based down in Charlottesville. One thing to highlight
about Torch, we managed every phase of the project. So, from identifying a promising location
for a project, reaching out to the landowners, the permitting process, as well as construction
and operation. So, since 2013, with the exception of a couple small projects we did for
electric cooperatives, we've maintained ownership in all of the projects that we've built.
And that's something that we take pride in.
Now, I know that you have gotten the solar 101 probably multiple times. So, rather than doing that
again, I just wanted to give you a little background on our community outreach and what we've
done in Frederick County. And we have met with several of the project neighbors and I attended
a meeting with some of the county officials, community meeting. But before that, we really did
make a proactive effort to reach out to the neighbors, meet with them, directly walk the project
site with them. And those meetings have really influenced the way in which we have planned the
project and the way in which we're presenting it. I think for starters, this is a good site
in that it's pretty isolated, not visible from the main roads. But we have put a lot of
thought into the design. We're using existing tree lines and vegetation topography everywhere
that we can. In addition to that, Evan will kind of go into the details, but we're proposing
several buffer areas where we will be planning new vegetation. In one spot, we're actually also
planning an earthen berm to go along with that. We're proposing that. The location of our substation,
as was mentioned, it's right next to the railroad, it's actually across from an industrial
zone parcel. It's kind of in the low ground and I think it will not even be visible to that landowner
that we're working with just because of the topography. This was kind of a specific one,
but the solar inverters, so those are the devices that convert direct current to alternating
currents and they're about twice the size of a refrigerator. That is a lot as an air conditioning.
We've agreed to have those a minimum 450 feet from any residences, so that's a very safe distance.
It will make sure that once it's operating, the project will not be audible to any of the
neighbors. It's very quiet. So with all of that, we've had several iterations of the concept
plan. I just wanted to give you that background for Evan kind of goes into the nuts and bolts.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just to talk briefly about the project area and the concept
plan. As Sam said, you can see from the aerial photography that around the perimeter of the project
area are fairly large parcels. There's no subdivisions immediately adjacent to the project.
There's also areas of the project where there's existing but you are woodlands and those are
to remain. Obviously, it's a better visual screen initially, but also for the purpose of the
project. It's less costly to to maintain the trees than knock everything down and plant new.
And then, as Tyler said in his presentation, there's properties that are within the town of
Steven City. So we took all that into consideration and the concept plan before you is dated June 28th.
That is the fourth iteration of the concept plan since we formally filed with the county.
And the reason for that is, as Sam said, there was a lot of outreach discussion with neighbors,
discussion with staff, discussion with decision makers. And there was a lot of good input that
was brought to the table and we were happy to add that to the project. So what you see tonight with
the concept plan, there's buffer details and that's important because instead of using a cookie cutter
buffer, we customized buffering to meet the requirements of the specific area of the project around
the perimeter. One question that Supervisor McCarthy asked staff, the number of lots that would be
permissible between the by-right development in the town and the RA development in the county is
about 255 lots in total. So with the layout, a couple of things that we were asked to consider and we
did. Springdale Road, we identified two locations that would be access points to the property after
it's developed. Both of them are generally across from each other. This would serve the Northern
Lambay, which is the 100 acre portion of West Oaks Farm Market and the R&T property. And then
Springdale Glen, this access point would serve what's now corrupt in the states and going further
down into the property. As you get to the southern part of the property, there's one access point
along passage road, there's also an area that we agreed to do for a lay down area, subtract
trailer trucks that are bringing the materials for the construction process of the site would only be
allowed to drop off on passage, which is a much less traveled road than Springdale, as those were
considerations that we made. The comment I was going to make about decommissioning supervisor
done asked, which is yes, the bond is evaluated and adjusted every five years to make sure that there
is sufficient funding for the removal of the facility once it's constructed. The other comment
Tyler mentioned the permit by rule. At the state level, they're looking more closely at environmental
impacts and historic impacts. We went to the county's historic resources advisory board and got
their approval with recommendations, but then there's also another layer of review by the
Virginia Department of Historic Resources that they would have to comply with once their permit is
issued by the state. So where the county really focuses more on the land use components,
transportation, buffering and screening, the permit by rule also puts another layer of review
for environmental that has to be approved for the project as well. So those are just a couple
things that I thought would be worthwhile to mention for the concept plan. And as I said, the
buffering is customized based on the requirements of the project and based on input we had received.
So hopefully we've done what we believe is a good job there. And I think Sam has a couple
closing comments about the project itself and then we'll be happy to answer any questions.
So I just wanted to give you an idea of the overall project timeline. It's been nearly two years
since we kind of identified this as a potential, you know, good area for solar. And obviously we're
seeking that the county land use approval, as was mentioned, we have to also complete a state
level permitting process, which is focused on the historical environmental resources, making
sure there's no, you know, no negative impacts there. So we're completing this studies now.
So with all of those things and with our work with Potomac Edison, who owns the transmission line,
we're planning to start construction in the second half of next year. And I'm kind of happy to
answer specific questions on the construction, but I did want to kind of explain the different phases
of it. So once the, you know, once the site has been prepared, you have what we call the
foundations phase. And when you look at this picture, those are the steel posts on which the
racking and the solar modules are mounted. And during that phase, you're also putting in the
you know, the inverters, putting those in place as well. You know, that's a relatively short phase,
you know, probably about two months. And you know, for any one area, we're talking about one month
to kind of, you know, put those posts in. And you know, obviously those are driven posts,
we're not, you know, covering the ground and, you know, in concrete or anything like that.
And we have had a few questions on, you know, the limestone or kind of rock outcroppings here.
And that's something that we study on every project. So, you know, these posts go in usually
five to eight feet. So not a whole lot deeper than fence posts, but we are studying it.
There may be areas that we have to, you know, pre-drill if there's rock near the surface.
British wanted to mention that is something that we're studying on this and that we study on
every project. Following that, you know, the mounting of the solar panels or the mechanical
installation that kind of requires the most manpower, but it's a much, you know, much less
loud part of the process. And then the, you know, the interconnection facilities that that kind
of spans all of the other phases that's us working with the utility to connect to that transmission
line. And that kind of goes through the whole, you know, the whole construction timeline.
But, you know, once the project is operating, it's a, you know, very passive use of the land.
The maintenance is very light. I think the most, I think the most site visits are due to,
you know, maintaining the vegetation. And for that, we either mow it or we, you know,
other projects we've grazed sheep on it. We don't use any herbicides in managing the vegetation.
So I just wanted to kind of go over those different phases. You know,
this is a project that would require no county services. I think it would contribute a great deal
both in us working with local firms and the, you know, the taxes that it would pay.
And thanks again for your time. And I'm happy to take questions. Thank you.
Well, other questions of either of these gentlemen. Mr. Chairman. Supervisor McCard.
Thank you. Mr. Land, you mentioned that you don't use herbicides on the land. That was actually one
of my major concerns was, you know, this has been touted as a way to sort of preserve farm land
for the future. You know, where it's, this project could be taken up and you still have the farm land
there in existence, which I think is a really good thing. If you pour herbicides on the land for
20, 30 years, you don't have a very good farm land at the end of it. Would you be open to having
that as a condition of this if we were to add that in order to get this approval that you would not
use herbicides as the primary control for vegetation? Yes, absolutely. We don't plan on using herbicides.
Thank you, sir. Those are done. I'll second the comments to Mr. McCarthy made. So if you can make
this subject to that agreement, we're good. Then there's simply a request and that would be not
to do it on holidays as well. I know this project is going to take you about a year to develop. Is that
correct? The construction is kind of the six to nine-month time. Okay. Sometimes there's more
for the interconnection. So during that time frame, I'd encourage you to not do it on a holiday as
well. I know you said Saturday. Sunday is a rough. I'm just throwing that comment out to you.
Last comment is that we had a solar project a month or so ago. This is the second solar project
and there may be a discussion on a third solar project. One of the comments that was raised to
me was, are you going to make Frederick County the solar county of the world? And so in discussions,
I've been understand that there are limited places where you can actually have a solar form,
transmit that power to the grid and then Frederick County is relatively limited.
Mr. Wyatt, if you have some thoughts on that comment to show what the limitations are, I appreciate it.
Certainly we have information and this is information that groups like Torch analyze when
they come into a community. They determine where the location of the high voltage lines are
and the substations and for the purpose of this map, the high voltage lines are shown in the
red and the substations are shown in the green. You may see that, and I might have to use my
laser pointer for this where there's an appearance that there's a thicker line here
than this line as well as here. That's because there's actually two different power lines that
run through there. One is a 500 KV line and the other is a 138 KV line. The way to look at the solar
first of all, it's my understanding the 500 KV line is just too cost prohibitive to deal with as
far as trying to tie into it because of the infrastructure requirements. The 138 KV line which is
the majority of the land line that comes up through the county around 37 and up into the north
and then through here. The things that the way that these are done, a group like Torch would go
and they would request an analysis by the Mid-Atlantic Regional group that does this and to
determine if there are capacity issues and or requirements to upgrade the infrastructure
and that really becomes the determining factor of whether or not a project is financially feasible.
The other thing to remember and it's almost analogous to a sewer treatment plant. A sewer
treatment plant has so much capacity and once you get to a certain level you have to spend money
to increase it whether it's the treatment capacity itself or the mechanics that go with it and
this is really no different. When you look at this, the 138 KV line, that's the capacity of the
but then the substations that are associated with it, they may have requirements that if you
were going to go in and try to do something that they couldn't handle as a condition of getting
the allowance to tie in, you have to go in and spend significant money to increase substation
capacities and things of that nature. So the other thing that's important to
further county of course has some unique topography characteristics. This part of the county
of course is Valley Ridge mountainous and it's very difficult, it would be very difficult to build
in there. On the eastern side of the county, even though you can't see the individual parcels,
you can see by the shading that those land areas are already pretty much divvied up for residential
development so you couldn't really get anything of significance in there. So this area of the
county and some areas up here would certainly be candidates but it's not something I think that
you would see predominantly taking over the rural areas of the county if that makes sense.
Thank you, Mr. White. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Two things that I wanted to ask the applicant itself.
I've had some feedback from the community on concerns, on security cameras surrounding the fence.
Will there be security cameras installed on the exterior fence line?
During operation we would not have cameras. We may have temporary cameras for security during
construction but in the long term we would not. Would you, in addition to that question,
would you be willing to add as a condition to the CUP that any cameras be facing only property
that is least and owned by towards and no properties of the neighboring properties to your
facility? Yes, you would be. Another item I would like a little clarification on. Number three,
on the conditional use permit as far as listed conditions. Talked about plantings. I know we've
discussed a couple of times and I just didn't see it present. I would like to make sure that it is
present. I wanted to get your affirmation that you were in agreement. There had been discussion
that plantings would be begun at the first optimal, most optimal growing season meaning.
If you started your project in June of next year, if that were to occur, that you would be planting,
you were planting at the first optimal growing season which would likely be in the September
time frame of that year to allow for the maximum growth and buffering prior to the panels being
placed. I know that was discussed a time or two. Are you willing to commit to that?
I understand the question that we would plant the buffer the first growing season after the
start of construction. The first optimal growing season post construction beginning. If construction
started in June, put your timeline in June or July, your first optimum growing season here
may be late August or early September. Would you be willing to commit to planting plantings as far
as the buffer at the first optimal growing season? Yes, we would. I guess I would just add that
there may be certain areas where there's a vehicle access that's used during construction that would
not be used during maintenance so it may make sense to plant those at the end. In general,
we're fine with that condition. That's what we would plan to do.
Further questions? Thank you. Other questions of these gentlemen? Anyone? Supervisor Slotter?
I spoke with Mr. Wyatt this week and we talked about noise components and I just for the record,
if you could speak to noise levels of any components of the project during its construction phase,
I understand obviously the pounding of the post and so forth, but once the project is up
in operational, would there be any impacts regarding noise components? That was a item that
Supervisor Graver wanted to discuss with us early on in the process. The inverters have a
decimal level of about 60 DBA and so the question was how far into the site would be reasonable to
have them placed so there was no noise level at the property line? What we concluded was that
450 feet of distance between any residents and the inverters would be more than reasonable to
ensure that there's no noise impacts. The way that the orientation of the panels is structured,
they run north to south because obviously as they rotate east and west sunlight is what they're
capturing and so the lines go pretty long and then the inverters are kind of in the middle.
So the 450 is a safeguard but in all likelihood for probably 90% of the project will be farther
away than that so there should be absolutely no noise level at the property line.
Other questions? Anyone?
Thank you, Joan.
Is the public hearing? Did we have folks sign up?
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. And I will note that you did have the three comments received
earlier and some email and the first name on the list is Sandra Diazagra.
If you come forward, sure your name, Magisterial District, and attempt to limit your comments to
three minutes or less, please.
Ladies, I'm Sandra Diazagra. I live at 628 Marble Road and Frederick County.
And I'm sorry with the masks. I missed. There was a question from this gentleman as to
there being a herbicide used and I didn't hear the answer.
Good not to use herbicides.
I've farmed in Virginia for good many years and honey suckle, Virginia creeper, poison IV.
The list goes on of noxious brush that if we have any other farmers in here that could tell you
that without any kind of herbicide or something to control that, those panels could be covered in one
season. And with herbicide would even, I would say, need two applications for this much land.
You're talking about a lot of chemical. If they're talking about sheep grazing, I've raised sheep,
too, and I don't think they were very practical for this application.
My definite question here is, I'm not quite sure, I have a question for you, how we got this far,
or how they got this far, in this, this, talking about this.
The mandates of the Commonwealth of Virginia and this county says that the limestone and clay
does not perk, doesn't perk. And there is a phenomenon with sheet with these large panels
of known as sheet flooding. And first of all, there's a drip line, you get heavy rains, you get
sheet, the sheet flooding, you get erosion. As the gentleman was saying, these are going to track
along with the sun, from the east to the west, the land slopes downward going down to the south.
And so when you get a drip line and you get this flooding, you get this erosion,
and this is all going down to what nobody has mentioned, is that Marble Road is a flood plain.
And in 2018, Marble Road sat underwater. And it took weeks, it took weeks, the county had to
retrench ditches, the old farmhouses that were built before the time of ordinances about being
built and floodstone, and flood zones were flooded. Water sit on that low land for weeks,
the house on the corner of Carter's Lane and Marble Road installed two pumps that pumped water
day and night for weeks to keep the water at ankle depth. That water sit on the land and made a
true believer to me that indeed, you know, your mandates, the land doesn't perk.
So, and in that, my husband and I have to conclude if you have water.
We have to have a alternative septic system because the land doesn't perk.
We had to pay $7,500 to change just the peat moss. Nothing else this year. We have to comply
with these rules. And I've seen the waters stand down there and I realize it's a problem.
But I want to know with all this sheet flooding, with them being on the hill with the flood zone
in the bottom, what exactly, I mean, how can they do this when the land will not perk and will not
accommodate this water? Thank you. And it's contamination. Kevin Snedden?
Welcome, sir. Your name, magisterial district and tribal
limiter comments, please, sir. Snedden, we're in the uppakin district.
Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity. May road.
There's a good. It's your in front or rotate it.
Thank you. Good evening. Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts and comments tonight.
Our home is actually located within the town limits. So, therefore, we paid tax to both
Frederick County and Steven C. During the last planning commission meeting, because we do live in
the town limits, our thoughts and comments were basically discounted, which was very discouraging,
even though we are Frederick County residents. On the other hand, Mr. Graber, he's done an amazing
job. He's been a great advocate for us throughout this whole process. And he's not even, you know,
our district representative. We really appreciate all of his efforts.
Throughout all this research, just like Torch said mentioned, they've started their research two
years ago. So, we've been under the gun and we've been, you know, trying to do a lot of research
to educate ourselves on solar. What other municipalities are doing and just in government in general.
Had we heard about this project longer, you know, when Torch started their research, you know,
we would have begun our duties at that time as well. You know, we do recognize that, you know, we
don't necessarily want to delay this project and we're the decision of this. However, we feel like
we're definitely at a disadvantage. It's not our intention necessarily to stop this project
than its entirety. However, it is our intention to keep our families and property values at their
utmost, at our most concern. We're concerned with the aggressive nature of the solar farms coming
into Frederick County. If this project is approved, this will be the second massive solar scale
solar farm industrial scale solar farm within three miles that was previously approved, as you all
know, the Fox Club. It's our concern that just the proximity of both of these is going to,
you know, devalue that property area as a whole. We urge that a total comprehensive plan be
developed so that we can preserve our lands and its intended uses. With that being said, we've
found that other solar ordinances, other municipalities have begun to create solar ordinances to put
in place safeguards to monitor groundwater for possible contaminants. Every five years,
the groundwater is monitored and tested. We asked for the cut sheets of these solar panels. They
were never presented to us. However, we had verbal affirmation that the panels are safe. However,
if one's damaged or something leaks, we really don't know that. That is a concern to us, the
groundwater. They've got water trees. They've got to clean their panels. Whereas all this water
coming from, you know, we don't want our wells to dry up as well. The other concern is decommissioning
in general. We understand that there's a decommissioning plan and that's to be reviewed every five years
and updated. However, we'd like to see that that is publicly disclosed. The other item is our concern
is just if for some reason, torch war to falter. The facility had to be decommissioned.
Where would all these waste products go? Does Freda County have the ability to take all this
capacity at that time? We've heard that some may be rebuilt or recycled. However, there's no
guarantee of that either. In closing, we'd like to see the decision delayed to allow ample time to
develop a solar ordinance and or to modify the existing CEP to include the groundwater monitoring
and fully just and add the fully disclosure of the decommissioning plans. Just like previously
stated in the agenda items tonight is brought up by Supervisor McCarthy. The school boards'
responsibilities to protect taxpayers and the related dollars. And we were asking that the board
Supervisors ensures the overall well-being of all Frederick County residents and a land that we
are protecting in a similar manner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Charles Heath.
Welcome, Mr. Heath. If we could have your name, magisterial district. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
My name is Charles Heath. I'm actually in Shawnee district, but I have property right up against
the solar farm. The only thing that separates my property from the solar farm is a high tensile
fence wire, five wires and post every 30 feet. And I tried to get access to the screen to show
everybody what we're going to see after this is over with. And I was refused at the desk and
said, well, you can't do that. That's only for people like Greenway and people that request to
permit. This is what we're going to see after everything is over with. It's an industrial solar
field. And if you have any questions, all you have to do is ride over to double toll gate,
take a look at what they've got. And we hear a lot about the screening. This is the screening.
This is after three years, three years of growth. And they've actually got 200 foot setbacks.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm very concerned. I know that they're, I want to thank
Sean for doing a super job because when we first met with Torch, all they were going to do was put
two rows of trees, or they call them saplings for foot tall, every 15 foot on center.
So it reminds me of what I saw at double toll gate. I don't know if I'll live long enough to see
those things cover up a good portion of that field. Now Sean did negotiate that we got a berm
to go in there about an average height of seven foot. Well, because the land rolls down and
rolls back up, that seven foot brings that berm right up level with the bottom of our fence folks.
So if you went over there today and planted trees or shrubs on top of the corn field,
that's where our screening would be. So I'm just saying I don't think it's effective. I think
it's helps. And I really do appreciate what Sean did because he had been over backwards to try
to help us. I think that something more needs to be done. And I'm not, I'm not the guy that's
got all the answers. I knew going to planning commission told me I had a bad attitude because
I said I can see what's going to look like after so with. I know these sketches and Greenway did
a great job of a section through a dam through a profile. That does not show you what you see
hit on. It's a world of difference. If you go to a dam and you cut a section out, you stand in,
you look parallel to that dam from one end to the other, anything you put there's going to block
you view. If you go around to the other side of the dam and look at the dam front on like I'm
looking at you guys right now, I can see between each one of you and you guys are about five foot
apart. Fifteen foot apart really stretches things out. So I'm just saying is the border supervisor,
I don't know what you can do because we were told that the planning commission they couldn't do
anything because the properties in Steven City. Now we're saying that we'll we can't do anything
because you got to wait for the site plan. So I'm just wondering what if anything can be done.
I've been paying Frederick County taxes since 1972 and I can plan to continue for you taxes
to Frederick County but I'd just like to have something to help me on the way. I appreciate your
help on it. Thank you sir, thank you. Jason Gordon.
Good evening Frederick County Board of Supervisors Chairman, other board members, citizens of
Frederick County and guests. My name is Jason Gordon. I live at 191 Brackenfern Lane,
Steven City, Virginia, and the Obacallan District. As a homeowner on 11 acres adjacent to the
proposed solar power plant, I'd like to begin my statement by thanking the members of our government
offices and industry for their time and attention and detail and trying to make the proposed
Bartonsville solar facility as beneficial to our county and as unimtrusive to its neighbors as
possible. Thank you especially to Mr. Sean Graber who I know has poured hours and hours of research
and discussion into this fast project. Thank you all sort of Tyler Klein, Mike Ruddy,
of the Frederick County Planning Department, Evan White, Greenway Engineering, Sam Gullin who
has answered our questions and concerns promptly and professionally. We'd like to think that our
fact-based questions and research have provided valuable feedback to torch energy into the county
and has highlighted many concerns of the Frederick County citizenship.
We understand the solar energy and in particular Utility Seal Scholar is a new development
and there are many lessons to be learned along the way in regards to regulation and negotiation
at a local level. We hope that you'll be patient with us as citizens of Steven City and Frederick
County as we try to understand the intricacies associated with a massive solar plant that is
of yet has no precedent in Frederick County. To the greatest extent possible we've attempted to
route our concerns to the Planning Department of Frederick County and at torch energy to Sean
Graber, Back Creek District Board of Supervision Member and Liaison of Frederick County Planning
Commission. However we still have a couple of concerns that a year have not been adequately
addressed by torch energy or have come to our attention as we have been spending the last few
months of our time basically taking a crash course on local government and the Utility
Scale solar industry. However we believe these recommendations could be incorporated with very
little cost. One important measure that I don't believe has been addressed into protection of our
firefighters and local emergency medical technicians to the coordination and proper training
in the event of fire and or near a solar power facility. I'm far from an expert on firefighting
but I research enough to know that there are unique requirements to be addressed when
firefighting a fire in a solar power plant. We need to ensure that coordination happens to
ensure our firefighters understand procedures to safely apply a fire suppressant to grass and
panels themselves without the risk of electrical shock and ensure that they are not prevented from
accessing lot gates and fences. Our second concern was addressed by Mr. Graber with the
security camera question. Thank you very much. Because our technology is rapidly changing,
third issue regarding solar panel construction materials, many localities implemented
testing of soil and local wells for other possible pollutants because there's no resources
as valuable to mankind as clean water. Our wells are vitally important to our health and
our children. The short distance from the solar power plant, which is less than a thousand feet
from one of the county's major water quarries. If there is a leaching of materials into the ground
or groundwater, we have very little time to determine scope and risk of the issue and take
corrective action before we have a countywide water contamination concern. Our next concern,
I'll mention here is the excessive noise produced during construction of the project.
And from this point, I'd like to allow my wife to continue if you don't mind.
Welcome. That wasn't for me. Okay, there we go. Thank you. Good evening,
Frederick County Board of Supervisors and honored guests. My name is Julie Gordon. I live on
191 Brackenfern Lane, Steven City, Virginia in the Opec and District. I'd like to take this time
to thank all of you for your service to our county and especially Sean Graber and John Joel,
who took time out of their personal lives to physically see for themselves the impact that the
project would have on our home and our properties. I'd also like to thank Sean for spending a huge
amount of time trying to do the right thing for the residents of Frederick County. As everyone is
doing schooling from home this year, I'm concerned about the noise generated through construction of
this project. According to a World Health Organization study conducted in 2011, chronic noise
exposure impairs cognitive function. Over 20 scientific studies have reported that noise adversely
affects children's academic performance. Studies show the following deficits and children exposed
to chronic noise, memory, reading, auditory discrimination, speech perception, academic performance
and attention span. While we understand the construction period will be for a limited time,
we're particularly concerned about the six to eight weeks during which pile driving and or boring
will be conducted. Just a quick review on the science of noise because I had to review this for
myself before presenting tonight. Noise levels are measured in decibels, a quiet room is typically
about 40 decibels. Humans perceive a 10 decibel increase in sound as a doubling of loudness. Sound
level decreases approximately six decibels for every doubling of the distance from the source.
Noise below 80 decibels are considered to not cause hearing loss. Studies by the World Health
Organization have shown that the majority of people become moderately annoyed by study
continuous sound levels above 50 decibels and seriously annoyed at continuous sound levels
above 55 decibels. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a pile driver is 110
decibels at 50 feet away. Since the closest panels to our property are only 100 feet from the
property line, that means that from our property line, from our backyard, from our children's
playset, the sound of the pile driver will have diminished to 104 decibels. By the time you get to
the porch on the opposite side of our home from the solar field, the sound will have dropped to 98
decibels. Just a reminder on the science now, 100 decibels is perceived as 32 times louder than 50
decibels, which is considered annoying by World Health Organization studies. If you assume that we
keep our children inside every day of the pile driving, as it spans from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, then that would afford us about a 10 decibel drop to around 88 to 90 decibels
within our home. Hearing damage occurs at 90 decibels over eight hours. The construction workers
will be wearing hearing protection during these processes, but how do you propose we protect the hearing
of ourselves and our children during these six to eight weeks of pile driving Monday through Friday,
8 a.m. to 5 p.m. We appreciate the effort the Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors has
taken to limit and mitigate the impact of construction on the community, but for those dwelling,
working, and schooling closest to the facility, this mitigation is simply not enough. I propose that
prior to the approval of the CUP, the Board of Supervisors should require torch energy to provide
advance notification of at least 30 days defining when they will be pile driving within a thousand
feet of a residence. And if they can consolidate pile driving in one area at a time, perhaps home
owners could arrange to stay elsewhere during the most intense period of pile driving.
Some other suggestions are for torch energy to submit a noise mitigation plan that could include
sound cartons and other ways of mitigating the noise of the pile driving, if you remember the
picture, that looked like a vineyard. Each one of those piles is as the result, or each one of
those poles as a result of the pile driving that happens. Thank you very much for your time.
Thank you. Douglas Neural.
Welcome, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Raise that microphone off the floor, please.
Thank you. Mr. Chairman and supervisors, I appreciate the opportunity to appear tonight.
And thank you for calling a hearing on the conditional use permit for the Bartonsville Solar Facility.
My name is Douglas Neural. My wife, Linda and I are nine-year residents of 510 Devlin Drive,
which is in the Gainesboro District. And we're pleased to be in that district.
We both retired to the Winchester area to maintain close contact with our daughter and family
who reside in Steven City. And the area's quality of life and opportunities for
community service were also reasons why we were attracted to this area.
I asked the board of supervisors two questions tonight. First, do you stand on the right side of
history in developing solar power in this community? And second, does this
particular vehicle for permitting solar power development in a particular location
really stand side-by-side with the community? Or is there a gap between the document and the
welfare of the community? First, let me respond to the first point and to commend the board
for supporting the production of clean, renewable resources. It will help to implement the
state's plan to transition and reduce our dependence on petroleum and fossil fuel products.
So that's a real positive. And it will also contribute to our nation's growing recognition that
we must harness clean resources to tackle global warming. Yet with due respect,
members of the board, I regret to say there is not a clear kind of answer to my second question.
I think there are several unresolved questions that we need to spend more time on.
First, the current plan to mitigate the project's visual intrusion on nearby residents
falls short as you have heard. Imagine looking out your back window at the equivalent of four
football fields of solar panels glaring in your face. With a mere 100-foot setback in a
berm and two rows of evergreen, do you really think that's going to allow residents to enjoy a real
view shed? I ask you, do you not parents and kids deserve the same privacy and buffers as
plants and trees? Second, during the COVID-19 pandemic, as Mrs. Gordon has pointed out,
the construction phase is a real problem because you're saying that kids should be in a learning
environment that's equivalent to having a rock band in their classroom. That does not work.
Third, the proposed fix for mitigating the inverter's cacophonous noise levels
needs a guarantee and it needs to be field tested, not just promised.
And fourth, the zoning ordinance governing the CUP requires compatibility,
compatibility with a utility grade solar facility with the county's comprehensive plan.
The planning staff says in its review, the project is generally compatible with the comprehensive plan.
Well, we need more than a pat on the back. We need real evidence that it is fully compatible.
And let me close by saying I ask then that a project of this open importance
demand real, careful, evidentiary proof that all of the conditions are going to work
and that they fit within the context of the comprehensive plan and the Department of Planning's
own vision statement. Finally, for these and other reasons, I appeal to the Board of Supervisors
to defer approval of CUP 05-20 for the Bartonsville Energy Facility until the issues that have
been raised tonight are adequately addressed. And I thank you all for your attention and for your
cooperation and for your diligence and working on this project. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Chairman, those are all of the persons who have signed up.
Thank you. For anyone else who wanted to speak concerning this conditional use permit,
anyone at all hearing none will close the public hearing.
Thank you. I'm sorry, I didn't see it. Where are you?
Thank you. There you are, sir. Thank you.
Welcome. Joseph Carball.
I agree. Oh, pecking. Thank you, sir.
I think I form our farm, family farm, own a passage lane,
and also form the Staples property, which is adjacent to our farm. And also borders
the property or the homes of some of the residents of my neighbors there. Excuse me.
I can sympathize. I mean, at the last meeting, they talked about the view being compromised.
I can sympathize with that. I've been blessed to have the landscape that I've had all these years
when I'm farming these fields back there. And it's just a reminder that of how much the
we are to be good stewards and caretakers of the land.
I cherish it every time I'm in those fields. And I knew that someday the landscape would change.
So I had pictures of it and mental images of the landscape.
You can look out your window and see solar panels or you can see houses
or you can see industry, whatever is going to be put on those properties. And something will be
put on those properties. It's just a matter of time. Or you can look out your window and look over
solar panels. But it's difficult to look over homes and big buildings. Excuse me.
There could be a lot of homes put on those properties. But there's no municipal water.
So that means every home would require a well. And since they don't build homes with
systems anymore, which they should, in my opinion, that's a lot of wells. And when you build a lot
of wells on property and extract water from the ground at a rate quicker than it can be replenished,
then that lowers the water table. And over time, it can create sinkholes where the ground is
susceptible to collapsing. It acts like a depression and a suction and it just creates like a
down draft. And it's a water pressure that helps hold up the ground underneath.
There's a lot of talk about getting off the grid. Well, Paul Harvey, who's deceased,
had a segment on his radio show called Not In My Backyard. If we all take out a approach,
then getting off the grid is going to take longer and could end up being more costly for all of us
in the long run. And the solar companies are attempting to do this. And they're also preserving
farmland because after the, or in the future, it can revert back to whatever it was in.
There's many ways to look at change. It all depends on the individual as to how we accept change.
So perhaps this is something that we can look at is this kind of change. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Is there anyone else that comments concerning this application? Anyone?
Anyone at all? And we'll close the public hearing portion of the meeting.
Mr. White, would you all like an opportunity?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of comments that I heard that I believe weren't a response.
There was a comment regarding using groundwater to clean the panels. The person that spoke may not
have been at the planning commission, but that same question was asked and the response was
that that's not how it's done. It's actually just done through a rainwater application.
The two comments, though, that I do believe weren't response. There was a question about potential
impacts from water runoff under properties. The concept plan does not show it, but when we move
into the site plan phase of the project, like any other project, it has to be designed and
engineered. It has to provide stormwater management facilities and locations where the water runoff
is going to go. The county ordinance requires us not only to develop them to account for
quality, but also for quality. So there is no impacts for the stormwater that run off the site.
The way the county is set up after these are engineered and installed, they're inspected
initially before there's an operation to move forward with permitting, but then there's also an
annual inspection requirement of those facilities. I just wanted to make that point, and then there
was a comment that I hadn't heard before that was regarding the fire and rescue. Fire and rescue
was part of the review agency process for this, and the two things that they asked for was to make
sure access roads are 20 feet of drivable surface, and that on the once the roads are designed
to identify zones and naming access roads within the site. So when they come out to a large
site like this, it's almost like having a road name, so to speak, and all that would be addressed
at the site plan. Thank you. Thank you, sir. All right. You're picking in, back creep.
Paul and I have talks. It's all in policy. We've decided he would take the lead.
All right, sir. Supervisor Graven. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to first stop and say thank you
to Supervisor Wells. This has been a very detailed project as you are likely grasping here this
evening, and I greatly appreciate his time and his words of wisdom and his pointing me in the
direction to find some answers from time to time, and it is much appreciated too. Thank you, Mr. Wells.
I thank everyone who came to speak this evening as some of you may be aware. I have had three
community meetings regarding this subject. I have asked that Sam come out and make a presentation
at the last and the largest of the community meetings, which he graciously did, and we have
tried to be diligent in answering the questions. As of today, when I spoke with Sam, I ask him
if there were any unanswered emails or unanswered phone calls or unanswered questions that he
was aware of that had yet to be returned regarding this project, and according to our conversation
at 230 today, the answer was no. Does that still stand? It still stands. I know personally,
I have made a strong attempt to answer every email, every phone call, and follow up on every
question that has been submitted to me regarding this project, and it's been encouraging to see the
feedback from the community, however, there's also been some times where I feel like the goalposts
have continued to change, and that has been a little bit of a struggle from time to time.
I would before I like to make a motion ask the applicant if he would be willing to add a
couple of things to his conditional use permit as part of conditions if that would be permissible.
He's willing should have gotten there earlier.
I say this in regards because they were brought up during the public hearing phase. Sam, would you
be willing to step to the podium to discuss this?
So earlier we had discussed the plantings at the first optimal planting season,
the organic weed abatement that was discussed previously.
The two things that were brought up that I think are things that definitely should be considered
are advanced notification of pile driving. I think that that is only considered for the community.
Would you be willing to give a minimum of two weeks notification to the community of any
pile driving which is to occur within a thousand feet of a residence?
Two weeks notice?
Two weeks prior notice, sir.
Yes, we know we would be willing to do that.
Secondly, I heard some concern about the seismic impact from drilling.
While looking at the site, there does not appear to be a large area of land that would
affect residents from drilling as far as based upon where residents are located in relation to
the project. But in so much as when you are within five hundred feet of a residence, would you
be willing to monitor the seismic impact from those drilling operations when you are performing
drilling operations near within five hundred feet of a residence?
I'm not familiar with that process. Generally, we drilling is usually not done and would only be in
very select places if a pile could not be driven in in the traditional way. I don't think that
there would be any significant seismic effects if we had to do that.
So you'd be happy to kind of look into that. I guess I'm not familiar enough with that process.
We've had projects where that is more accustomed to where there's blasting that's going to occur.
And blasting is not going to be done for this particular project.
I'm not sure that the requirement and the cost and the monitoring for something that's going
to be selective drilling is really going to be appropriate. I think if it was a blasting
situation without question, there should be seismic monitoring. But drilling, I don't think it'd
be necessary. Thank you. Those are my only questions. Mr. Gillard, I appreciate your time.
Thank you, gentlemen. With those thoughts, I'm going to make a motion that we
approve conditional use permit 05-20 for the Bartonsville Energy LLC, as I believe it is in substantial
accordance with the comprehensive plan. As part of my motion, I would like to see included in the
conditions that the plantings on number three, that the plantings be planted at the first optimal
growing season after the initial phase of the project has begun. That all weed abatement
be organic and no herbicides will be utilized during the life of the project.
That and that advance notification be given two weeks prior to any pile driving occurring
on the site and there ends my motion. Her demotion is her second.
Like the most chairman. And his second. Discussion.
Mr. Chairman. Yes. I'd like to make a motion to amend the existing motion.
Mr. Grover, you mentioned that you think that the weed abatement should be organic,
that word in and of itself concerns me a little bit because it's such a broad category.
I could take salt, which is organic and salt the land, and it would kill the weeds, but I can
never farm one it again. It's kind of like what the Romans did to the Carthaginians.
So I'd like to strike that word from it and just have it say that the condition is that the
primary weed control method shall not be herbicides.
I heard the proposed amended motion. Is there a second?
I'll second it.
And discussion. Is there any? Anyone?
Okay. So we're voting on the proposed amended motion with the change in wording to
the use of herbicides. Supervisor Fisher.
Hi. Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Slotter. Supervisor Well. Supervisor Dunn.
Hi. Supervisor Grave. Hi.
Chair votes aye and the motion carries. So now that becomes the primary motion with the conditions as amended.
Is there any further discussion?
Supervisor Dunn.
Chairman, this is a balancing act between land use and solar farms.
My house sits behind what is now sovereign village, which used to be a nice farm.
But I'm very sensitive to the comments that were made on noise.
So I would strongly encourage, I'm for the word strongly encourage,
torch to give notice for two weeks and all you can to mitigate that noise.
I know it's for the intense period of time for short time frame.
But letting people know that it's going to start in a certain time and then to
approximately a certain time would be extremely helpful.
I've been on the receiving end of construction and sovereign village with a dying mother
and there was no consideration. So I'm just thinking that comment to you, sir.
Hope you give it consideration. Thank you.
Further discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, this has been a really difficult one for me.
A lot more difficult than the last one that we did.
Primarily not because I think the project and of itself has any inherent flaws,
but because there's so many neighbors who have concerns.
One thing I will say is that a lot of the concerns that were brought forward to us,
either an email or in tonight during the public hearing seem to have been addressed
to a great extent by some of the mitigating activity that the organization says that they'll take.
It seems like there was a lot of misinformation that was out prior to the
first public hearing with the planning commission that may have been clarified.
I think there's a lot more clarification tonight.
For me, I think eventually, and I think at the last borders we were
about just meeting Mr. Weber made a good statement that eventually the day will come when we will
need to rely upon our local farmers for our food and not farmers in China and South America and
other places. And to me, that's a great concern because over my short 44 years on this plan,
I've seen the farmland and this county be gobbled up and turned into housing developments,
turned into industrial developments. And I think Mr. Carball being a man of the land,
he's very wise and he knows what he's talking about when he says that we can look over the solar
panels. You can't look through the houses. This will provide farmland for the future,
especially with the additional provisions that Mr. Grieber has put into it regarding the herbicide.
So while I do certainly feel for those who are concerned about what may be going up in their
backyard, I think for the good of Frederick County in the long term, this is a good project to
move forward. So I'll vote in favor of it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir. Further
discussion, anyone? Mr. Chairman. Supervisor Grieber. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This has probably been
the hardest decision that I've ever had to make simply because of the conversations that I have had
with the residents and I know it is very personal. I have done my best to speak with other
localities and have these installations installed and also have ordinances in place. And what I have
been told by some of those supervisors in other localities is the conditions that we have put in place
are actually more restrictive in many areas than what the ordinances call for in their solar
ordinance plans. I think that that is a testament to the residents being willing to come forward
and share their thoughts and share their concerns. And I thank them for being an active part
of the community and sharing their thoughts and concerns because it has changed this project
considerably. The cost of the berm, the berm that's being installed, I know it's not going to have an
immediate immediate effect, but it will vastly improve the blocking of site or vision from those
three or four residents that are majorly impacted much quicker than they'd be planted on the ground.
And just to put perspective to this, those residences are in the town of Steven City. And
therefore it is a by-right use. By code, towards energy did not have to do any of the additional
items in which they did. One of those was the berm an additional item was is they set back
where they had originally planned to put panels on multiple different areas surrounding
those properties to try to be a good neighbor. And I know it's been challenging and I know it's
been difficult, but I appreciate the two parties being willing to work together and I cannot
extend my thank you to the respectfulness and the courtesy shown by both parties. That's all.
The comments, anyone? All right. Supervisor Graver.
Hi. Supervisor Dunn. Hi. Supervisor Wells. Hi. Supervisor Slaughter.
Hi. Supervisor McCarthy. Hi. Supervisor Fisher. Hi.
Chair votes aye. Motion carries.
And we thank you all for your participation and your patience.
So it'll bring us to ordinance amendment, Frederick County Code Chapter 165, Mr. Klein.
Bear with me one second and sir, we'll look to the slides.
Yes, this is a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance to expand our definition for daycare
facility to include adult care and to use consistent terminology for daycare facility throughout
the ordinance. The current definition for daycare facility limits these services to only children.
An amendment to the definition is proposed as follows, a facility in which five children and
or adults, not including persons who are related by blood, marriage or adoption to the people
who maintain the facility, are received for care, protection and guidance during only part of a 24-hour
day. Daycare facilities as defined in our ordinance are currently allowed as a conditional use
in the RA rural areas and RP residential performance zoning districts. Staff notes that the use
child care service, child daycare services rather are allowed in our B1 neighborhood business,
B2 general business and OM office and manufacturing park zoning district and these uses are defined
using the standard industrial classification or SIC codes. The proposed amendments at the direction
of this board would also revise child care, child daycare services terminology to daycare facilities
as defined in part 101 of the ordinance as amended in the B1, B2 and OM zoning districts for
consistency. The proposed amendment would not change which zoning districts and this type of
facility is allowed by right or through a conditional use permit and adult care facilities like
child care facilities are regulated by the Virginia Department of Social Services in addition to
those requirements contained in the zoning ordinance. Further, for uses such as churches where
a daycare facility may be accessory to the principal use such as a place of worship, these
facilities would continue to be allowed by right. This ordinance amendment was proposed by a local
engineering firm working in conjunction with Westminster Canterbury to allow this use in the RP
residential performance zoning district and the board of supervisors discussed this item on August
12 and directed staff to ensure the consistent use of the terminology for daycare facility
throughout the ordinance. The Planning Commission held a public hearing on September the second
and recommended approval and this item is presented to you all this evening as a public hearing item.
Following the public hearing staff is seeking action by the board of supervisors on this proposed
ordinance amendment and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. Thank you. Thank you sir.
Questions of Mr. Klein, anyone?
Thank you, sir. This is a public hearing. Is there anyone who would like to comment concerning
these proposed changes to the ordinance? Anyone at all? Anyone? Seeing no one will close the public
hearing? How would the board like to handle this? Mr. Chairman, yes sir. I would move that this
board adopt the revision to the county ordinance to include the care and protection and guidance
of adults and additional children and to include this definition in the B-1, B-2 and O-M districts.
Heard the motion? Sir, second. Second. Quite a few. Is there any discussion? Anyone?
Supervisor Fisher. Hi. Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Slaughter. Supervisor Wells.
Hi. Supervisor Dunn. Hi. Supervisor Graber. Hi.
Chair votes aye. Motion carries and the changes are adopted. That will bring us to a withdrawal
of number 13. Were liaison reports? Are there any? Mr. Chairman. Yes. I believe we need a motion
to withdraw item number 13. Okay. Now I would so move that we withdraw this until the first meeting in
November and take it up at that point. All set. So in a second. I'll second it. Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir. Do we have applicants consent to that date and do we? Could we please have that stated
on the record? Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. I did speak with Mr. Lawson if he'd like to come up.
He did confirm that that would be an appropriate date. Okay. Thank you, sir.
Welcome, sir. Welcome. Thank you very much for the record, Ty Lawson, and yes.
Thank you very much. Well done. All right. So we do. Thank you, Mr. Williams.
All right. So we're ready to vote and that would be Supervisor Graber. Aye.
Supervisor Dunn. Aye. Supervisor Wells. Supervisor Slot. Supervisor McCartney. Supervisor
Fisher. Aye. Chair votes aye and the motion carries. Thank you, Supervisor McCartney.
Board Liaison reports, are there any?
Citizen comments on any issue? What's whoever that you'd like to share with the board?
Anyone? Anyone with all? Seeing no one? We'll close the public comment period. Board of Supervisors
comments are the ring. Just like the chime in of the Supervisor McCartney as new convenience site
is fantastic. It's such a great addition out there. The school system worked with us on that,
and everything is we were out there today. It was just just a great, great project. And
under budget, game and under budget, fantastic. Great job. They did a wonderful job.
Anyone else? Supervisor McCartney. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I just want to extend a thanks to all the residents in Gainesburg District and other districts who
came out to support Reynolds Shore Fire Company for their yard party. It's been tough with COVID to
have a traditional yard party. So they had sort of a drive through yard party and raised a
significant amount of money. So I think it's wonderful to see the community getting behind the
local volunteer organizations. In addition, I know the local Presbyterian Church also had a yard
party last weekend and they raised significant money. So I think it's a testament to our county
that we still stick together. We come out and support one another. And I think it's just a
wonderful thing. And I say it over and over again, but I'm so proud to live in Gainesburg, where
such great people are my neighbors. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir.
Anyone else? Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It has come to my attention by several different members of the
community in which I represent that they are homeschooling their students, their children,
or sending their children to private schools. There was some fear that they may be falling behind.
And some of these families are larger families and some of these families are very hard working
folks down down to our assault on the earth type of folks. And they put in just a couple comments
that wanted to see what the board may be able to do at some point for next year's budget
on reducing tax rates for folks who are not sending their children to school, essentially a real
estate or personal property tax credit. I would like to see this board consider that,
have dialogue related to that as we begin to prepare the 2022 budget year.
Would not have to be a huge amount. Simply books, as it's been stated, is around 500 hours per
student. Uniforms, if they go to a private school, sometimes run 300 or 400 hours. So 500 or
a thousand dollar credit, I don't believe it would be unreasonable. And it was in the long run,
if we look at the numbers that are presented by the school system, save us money.
For every student in which role is enrolled in the school system, it costs the county in the
neighborhood of $7,000 to educate that student according to the school board's figures.
Therefore, it would be a substantial savings to the county if we work to give a credit and allow
these parents who have other means of teaching their children and desire to do so,
a little financial flexibility to do so. So it just kindly asks this board to consider that
as we begin the process of preparing next year's budget. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Anyone else? Chairman? Yes, sir?
I can make a follow-up comment to supervisor gravers. I guess the first question I would
want answered before we take that up is, are we authorized as a county to take on such a credit?
But beyond that, I do think that there are things that we can do. So for instance, I know that
the county administration sent out a request this week to us as supervisors to ask us what the
legislative agenda should be for the state legislature in the next term. And I think that
could very well be at the top of that legislative agenda. So therefore, I would encourage supervisor
graver and anyone else that's interested in this to put that into the list of items that should
be taken up during this term. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Any other comments
anyone? Vice Chairman Wells. Mr. Chairman, I move we adjourn. Second. Second. Second. All those in favor,
aye? Aye. Thank you all for your time, attention, your input. All your hard work will stand adjourned.
