I call to order, meeting of the May 6, 2020 Federal County Planning Commission.
I'd like to welcome the people here tonight.
Before we do a moment of silence, I would like to thereby keep in our thoughts our country
under the current conditions of the coronavirus and COVID-19.
At this time, I would like to ask for a moment of silence, please.
Thank you.
The first item tonight is the adoption of our agenda to have any changes or modification to the agenda.
If there is none, I'll entertain a motion for approval.
So moved.
Second.
Motion is second, all those in favor?
Aye.
Aye.
Thank you.
The next item, since we have not met, and as you see by the agenda, we have numerous minutes to approve.
We've got the October 2nd, 2019, October 16th, 2019, November 6th, 2019, December 4th, 2019.
December 18th, 2019, and January 15th, 2020, is there's no changes to the minutes as they presented to have a motion to approve.
So moved.
Second.
All those in favor of approving the minutes as I listed.
Aye.
Aye.
Thank you.
Next item, one, our agenda is committee reports.
And the first one I have is our new committee chair, Mr. Embroidery, DRC.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Who's that on that?
I guess last, he was February 27th, and took up the following items.
We've all elected a chairman, myself, vice chairman Gary Oates.
Next, we discussed the zoning ordinance, techs amendments, and the items that were directed to us by the Board of Supervisors.
The proposed changes to the development review fees for conditional use permits, specifically the telecommunication facilities.
And this item will come up before the planning commission tonight.
Lastly, the county attorney made a presentation to us about the existing enforcement of zoning ordinance penalties, how you remedy that.
It's clearly set out in your agenda tonight.
And then we're adjourned. That was it.
All right. Thanks, sir.
Welcome.
There's no report from Frederick water.
There is good.
A report from Frederick, Mr. Oates.
Yes, Frederick water met on April 21st.
We adopted the 2021 budget.
It was also announced that the water lines are in place for the orchard due elementary school.
And our plant in Steven City can receive water from the wells on site and send tree to water back to the school.
The Route 37 water loop is now complete.
And our two Frederick water plants are available or can now provide water to all of our customers.
We still are required to purchase a minimum of 625,000 gallons a day of finished water from Winchester.
However, that contract will expire in 2022.
The new water plant in Stevenson is currently in the bid process.
Those bids are due next week and construction will begin in early summer.
The rainfall for February was 2.44 inches and March was 2.21 inches.
And our clear brook and Steven city quarries are staying full.
I don't think we have one from transportation.
It has not met conservation.
Is Mr. Triplet?
No report.
No meeting.
Keep going down the list.
I don't think Mr. Moon has one for CPPC.
Historical resources.
And there's no represent from Winchester planning commission tonight.
So it brings us to our board of super liaison.
Supervisor Graber.
Mr. Chairman, thank you.
I'd just like to bring the light to things that you have before you tonight under tabs D and E.
And I just wanted to provide a little bit of background in what several supervisors have voiced for you to consider this evening.
Tab D is on CUPs and the costs affiliated with that with the towers.
What has been presented to me by several supervisors is twofold.
One, as you set the fee, whatever that fee you believe to be most appropriate.
There is some desire to understand how you arrived at that figure, whether that be 750, 1500, whatever that number is.
Just so there is some form of understanding as to why the fee was set where it is in regards to having consideration for those in our community.
Who have voiced concerns about not having money to pursue a CUP for private use for internet towers at the residents.
Also, if you will look at tab E in your packet this evening under zoning enforcement violations and penalties.
Some of the comments that have been brought forth by several board members were.
It has appeared in the past that when there is a zoning violation that some of the businesses have felt like it was just a cost of doing business.
They would just pay the fee and go on and maybe have had made it difficult to bring them into compliance.
At the February meeting, first February meeting, there was a considerable discussion about the board and the board voted obviously to bring it to you this evening to increase those fees to make it a little more impactful.
So folks may not think, well, just blow this fee off and just go on.
So both items are before you tonight.
Just wanted to put some perspective to you.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Thank you, sirs. That your report then for the last board supervisor meeting.
It is the last board meeting was for budgeting purposes for the most part.
This board or the planning commission had not met since February.
The allow us to consider those things.
Thank you.
Our next item to the citizen comments.
And since we're very limited on our citizens tonight, I don't believe we'll have citizen comments, but I'll open the floor to that.
And since I don't see anyone coming for them, we'll close the citizen comments.
Our first item is a public hearing item.
It's a conditional use permit number 01-20 for J.K. Lee Services, Mr. Chair.
Like Mr. Chairman, members of the planning commission.
This property is located at 549 Valley Mill Road, it's a red bug magisterial district.
It's current land uses assisted living facility.
It's a zoned RP.
And the proposed use of expansion of that facility.
This is an application for an expansion of the facility.
The adult care facility is allowed within our RP zoning district with improved conditional use permit.
This facility first was approved in 1996 for a continued care facility through a CUP.
And it was built with a community block grant.
Facility currently is operating under a subject to conditions of a conditional use permit.
It was approved in 2004.
And that conditional use permit allowed for a 5600 square footed addition to the facility.
The addition was for a new physical therapy room and eight additional residential rooms to the facility for a total of 34 beds.
This new application before you tonight is a proposed to add six more additional residential rooms within the existing structure to allow the facility to expand to a total of 40 beds.
As you're all aware of most of our conditional use permits have if you're going to do any expansion.
That's come before this body.
Obviously a board supervises for final approval.
This is the, I think we should be all should be board familiar with this.
So again, up on Valimil road. It's the care facility up there.
Doned RP.
This is the original site plan and updated site plan original site plan was updated when we've done the addition back in 2004.
I mean, put it really simple.
I just want to add some rooms in there.
They had to come back in front of the this body and the board supervise for approval.
Should the planning commission find this used to be appropriate staff recommend the following conditions number one or review agency comments.
So we can apply with it all times.
Number two, the applicant must comply with all requirements of state and kind of goes pertaining to adult care facilities at all times.
Number three, any expansion modification this use sure require a new site planned and a conditional use permit.
Mr. Chairman, I'll be here. I have to answer your questions. You were any of the planning commissioners may have.
There is the applicant is also here if there should be any questions. Thank you.
A question from Mr. Chairman.
I see none. Thank you, sir.
Would the applicant like to come or speak to us?
Mr. Chairman, the applicant has no comments at this time unless you have any questions of the applicant.
Does anyone have any questions of the applicant?
Thank you. Thank you. Thank the person. Thank you.
At this time, I'll open a public hearing.
This is a public hearing item. Anyone would like to come forward to speak for against this item. Please come forward this time.
I can see in there. There's no one. I'll close the public hearing.
Mr. Chairman, if I could also add that, of course, nobody came for the public hearing this evening.
And because of the current situation, we provided additional opportunity through a public web forum for public comment and we received non prior to today's meeting.
Thank you, sir.
So any questions, discussions, anything on my PC members?
Good.
I think it's been a good, good, good business and I think we've supported the county well.
Who's district command here?
Redbud.
There's no questions and no discussion. I'll entertain a motion from Redbud.
Mr. Chairman, I would recommend approval of conditional use permit number 01-20.
Second.
Second.
I got a second.
So I'll start voting. This is going to be different.
Let me start with Mr. Washington down here.
Mr. Washington, yes.
Manual, yes.
Votes, yes.
Thomas, yes.
Yes.
Mona, yes.
Dawson.
Dawson, yes.
Morrison, yes.
Klein, yes.
Roger, yes.
And chair votes, yes.
Don't I miss anyone?
Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Jewel.
I knew I would leave somebody at you. Mr. Jewel.
Yes.
Sorry, sir. Forgive me.
And the chair votes, yes.
So the motion carries.
And this will go to the Board of Supervisors with the May 27th.
Yes, May 27th, 2020 meeting.
Thank you.
Next item.
Our agenda is an information discussion item number 02-20 for Heritage Commons, Mr. Klan.
Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the planning commission.
This is information discussion item.
For you all to consider this evening for the Heritage Commons development.
And this is a proposal to develop 141 plus or minus acres of land zone R4 residential
planning community property for a mixed use community in the Shawnee district.
The properties subject to this master development plan or MDP are part of rezoning
in 1015 known as Heritage Commons, previously known as the Russell 150 site.
And these were approved December 9th, 2015 with proffers.
I can direct your attention to the screen.
The subject properties are outlined in blue.
And they are highlighted in orange, which is the R4 zoning district.
The Western property boundary is contained by I-81.
And the Eastern property boundary is contained by Front Royal Pike.
The property is bisected by Future Crossover Boulevard, which is a county revenue sharing project
that's currently under construction, which includes a connection to the city of Winchester.
I'm sure you're all very familiar with this project.
The master development plan for Heritage Commons includes up to 1645 multifamily residential housing units.
A minimum of 107,500 square feet of commercial development, including the uses in the B1, B2,
and B3 zoning district, right-of-way dedication for future warrior drive extended,
which is a north-south connection through this property, which I'll highlight in the next slide.
Preservation of the sensitive environmental features on site, specifically Buffalo liquor run,
which bisects the site as well.
And that's going to be an area preserved for recreational purposes.
And there's future interpersonal connectivity with adjacent existing residential uses,
including Madison Village, and several other subdivisions in the vicinity of the site.
Again, direct your attention to the screen for orientation.
Interstate 81 is here.
And Front Royal Pike is here on your screen.
Crossover Boulevard is the serpentine roadway with a roundabout that bisects Heritage Commons,
shown in the master development plan with the dotted line is the future 92 feet of right-of-way for a warrior drive,
which is an improved major collector roadway running north-south through the site.
In blue is the preservation of the sensitive environmental feature Buffalo liquor run here.
And then you have your various land bays that comprise your residential and commercial land uses.
The master development plan for Heritage Common appears to be consistent with the approved rezoning application 1015,
specifically the proper statement, and with the requirements of our late of the zoning ordinance,
which is our master development plans requirements.
And this MVP is in a form that is administratively approval.
Again, this MVP is presented to the Planning Commission this evening for information discussion.
No action is required by the Planning Commission, but staff will certainly convey any comments that are made on the application to the Board of Supervisors.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Klein. Any discussion? Any questions? Anyone?
Any concern?
Anyone? Thank you.
Seeing no one, keep moving.
Next item one, our agenda is a review for fees for the commercial telecommunication facilities.
That's also Mr. Klein.
So this is again an ordinance amendment for information discussion purposes this evening on development review fees.
This is a proposed amendment to chapter 165, the zoning ordinance, and to the development review fee schedule to reduce the fee for a conditional use permit for a commercial telecommunication facility.
The purpose of the reduction in this fees is to encourage commercial telecommunication facilities to locate and underserved areas of the county, specifically those areas that are rural and located primarily west of interstate 81.
In December 2019, you all will recall the Board of Supervisors adopted the two track process for the review and approval of telecommunication facilities.
That created a by-right allowance for towers up to 50 feet in height that would be approved administratively by staff and a standard process projects process for towers 51 feet or greater in height.
And those would be continued to require a conditional use permit and those would be subject to a public hearing by the planning commission of the Board of Supervisors.
The additional use permit fees for these types of uses were identified as a potential barrier to local service providers and applying for telecommunication facility permits.
The Board of Supervisors further directed staff to reevaluate the fee schedule with the attention of reducing the fee.
And that was to be considered separately from the two track process amendment, which is where we are today.
The Development Review and Regulations Committee discussed this item at their February 27th meeting.
At the time, they were given a proposal for towers 51 feet in greater in height or those fees subject to the standard process required a conditional use permit of $750.
The $750 fee is consistent with the conditional use permit fee for all other uses listed in the zoning ordinance.
It is primarily designed to cover the costs of advertising in the local paper and to sending the adjoining property under notifications.
The DRC and their discussions regarding the fees recommended a tiered fee schedule, specifically that for towers for 51 feet to 100 feet in height, the fee would be $1,500.
And for towers 101 feet in height and greater, the standard $7,000 fee that is currently in place would continue to apply to those towers.
At their March 25th, 2020 meeting, the Board of Supervisors adopted a temporary code amendment that's running through May 24th, 2020.
And that changes the conditional use permit fee for telecommunication facilities.
Again, that current fee was $7,000 and the temporary code amendment reduced the fee for all standard process projects to $750.
We're currently operating under that $750 fee and we have received several applications for conditional use permit.
This ordinance amendment is presented to the Planning Commission this evening for information discussion and comments from the Planning Commission will be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors.
Ultimately, the Board of Supervisors deems this to be an appropriate amendment and may come back to this body for a public hearing at a later date.
And I'm happy to answer any questions you have. Thank you.
Thanks, sir. Any questions? Mr. Thomas.
Have we been able to track typically what it's cost us to do a communications tower, CUP, and in categories, 100 feet and less, and the larger ones?
Do we have any idea have we captured any typical costs for staff to process those applications?
We're not tracking those costs. Again, the costs that we are tracking relate to the advertising and the adjoining property notifications.
As I understand it, when that $7,000 fee was adopted, it was designed to cover legal and or other third party consultant fees for the evaluation of the facilities.
But typically, a lot of the work that would have been done by a third party at the time is now done by the applicants.
That's your balloon test and fairficate your propagation studies and things like that.
So that's where that fee came from. But in regards to your question, no, the only fees that we track in regards to our time on these conditional use permit applications is the advertising and the public meeting notifications that go out to the adjoining properties.
Since we changed the height requirements, could you break down how many applications we typically get that are from individual users and what are the big commercial users?
Is it 90% commercial, 10% individual? Is it 50, 50?
I can't speak specifically to those numbers because the ordinance memo just just took effect in January.
Mr. Chair may be able to give a better evaluation. He's been reviewing the administrative applications that we've received and I do believe we have several conditional use permits for private commercial telecommunication facilities for private owners that have come through recently.
Do you want to jump in? Did you define that for what you just said?
So it's a commercial telecommunication facility provided by a local service provider, but it's on a private individual's property, like a homeowner and so they were doing a land lease of some sort, I guess, with the private homeowner and they're building a commercial tower on a property with the land lease.
Yes, sir.
It's just like a cell tower.
Essentially, it is a cell tower, but it's servicing one individual household as opposed to a service in one household.
Yes.
I'm sorry, Mr. Chair.
Currently, since we put the, as Mr. Clown's point, not the drop the fee for now, we've got three applications currently that were applied for conditional use permits
for higher tires than the 50 hours than the 50 that the state code required us to change.
We've got, we actually have one that was administratively approved.
That applicant has since come back and he's a greater height.
As Mr. Clown pointed out, so that was the first one Mr. Thomas that came was a ministerial reviewed.
They have since come back in for conditional use permit or for conditional use permits out there right now.
And the state code changes, Mr. Clown pointed out was if you were at 54, what we were having the issues, not the play the issue here for the night was we had some legal towers or had been put up.
And we're working through that right now.
And we have four, like I said, condition use permits comes to clean that up, but that's where you're at.
What height are they?
They're actually on our feet or more.
A couple of them.
We're having private towers built that are over 100 feet.
Air, it's a commercial.
It's technically commercial tower for what the use is there.
So in other words, I'll come to your residence and let's say you built a tower to get internet service.
And that tower has been used only for you, but it could be for the co-locate put other arrays on there to serve a bigger.
Bigger audit.
I mean, if you were only cut it down to make it short and simple as Mr. Clown's point, not basically the same thing, whether you have a hundred ninety nine foot one.
That you either approve or not are a small one, once you co-locate put things on that.
It is what it is telecommunications tower.
And the small saw just was passed to serve these areas as he pointed out that they come with the Virginia had us.
Approved for 50 foot.
We set the fee up.
It's again, he pointed out that's reviewed just a staff time.
They'll come in front of you.
We look at it.
They pull a building permit.
Pay the dollar.
A hundred dollars and they're on the road one our way.
Once a tower gets built.
A commercial size tower or a private piece of property that supposedly is for a single use.
For a single person use.
They have we have no recourse.
If they say I need to offset these costs that I've got involved.
I've got up to this point and I start bringing other users on.
They're perfectly within the code in ordinances to do that.
If they've come in and have asked and got the hundred, you know, if staff was looking at the.
Because you got to, like I said, a two track step here.
Yes, because we want you to co-locate as you all have passed additional use permits.
We're telling communications ties on one of their requirements is that.
The small cell that pointed out that was changed.
It was a front of here to 50 foot.
If you pulled in today.
Apply for it.
It's a ministerial reviewed.
Pulled a building permit meets all the zoning ordinance requirements.
We just signed the permit and it goes forward.
They paid a fee.
Now someone wants co-locate on that.
They co-locate on it.
And a lot of these are smaller just so we understand.
I think Mr. Klein really spelt that out as you were at the R.S.
A lot of these are smaller companies, not like the.
The ATTs that enormously are singular that you normally see the last 165 foot tire that was.
Wasn't approved.
You know, it's pretty big tire.
We have a hundred and we have another one.
It just came in from 199.
So it's the same, same business.
How much do you have another question?
I guess not.
Yes.
And reading the agenda.
I see is that everyone's opinion that.
With the DRRC that the 750 figure was.
Institution.
At that meeting, we had two people that expressed concern about.
Raising the fee to the 1500 and that's.
But again, we don't.
That committee doesn't take like a roll call vote.
It's just kind of like is there a consensus among the committee?
We had a lengthy discussion about that fee being $1500.
They set that fee.
You know, acknowledging that the towers probably between 51 feet and 100 feet are going to be for.
Individual property owners.
But there is still staff time devoted to reviewing and processing those applications.
And that the towers above 100 feet.
The towers are going to be your commercial entities, your AT&T's, your Verizon's, your centels.
And that that fee should remain unchanged.
Getting back to Mr. Thomas' question.
Again, we just don't have the volume of applications at this point to evaluate maybe where we are at with the breakdown of administrative versus 50 to 100 feet, 100 feet and greater at this point.
And I guess my thought there why I was asking the question.
It appears to me that we would like to have a tiered fee for individual private ownership of the towers.
But we do encourage co-location.
But when we start getting taller towers, even if it's 80 or 90 feet, the probability of co-location on a 90 foot tower is much higher than co-location on a 50 foot tower unless the geography is totally different there.
But when we'd be better off doing a tiered approach that say from 70 foot or 75 foot below, maybe go with a 750 feet or the 1500 feet.
From 75 feet to 120 feet, maybe make it $2,500 because those are going to be more of a profit making enterprise for the individuals.
And you're going to have more companies like Winchester Wireless and I that are trying to get in there to build 120 foot towers or 100 foot towers and put multiple antennas on it.
And then the big commercial towers that take up space and take a lot of time to evaluate, maybe make them $5,000.
Anything over 125 feet make it $5,000 or $7,000.
Wouldn't we be better off coming or wouldn't that more closely cover our costs or anticipated costs than having the two tiered approach that we kind of have that gap in there.
I think the 75 to 100 to 125 foot towers that still may be for smaller areas, unlike say into private areas, but they might be for a five acre development that has 20 houses in it.
That need internet and a $7,000 cost to them is much more significant than a $2,500 cost would be, but we'd still be able to cover the county's costs more closely than having the two tiered system.
That's certainly a common that can be relayed to the board of Supervisor. I think the committee, the DRC discussed that tier and they were trying to keep it as straightforward as possible, not getting in.
I'm not a professional engineer. It comes to telecommunications either of the people in the committee. We were trying to evaluate what is deemed appropriate given costs and what we can anticipate from a number of applications coming in.
So it's certainly a valid point.
Yeah, Roger, the committee, we kind of were thinking along what you were just saying. Only we were looking at 50 to 100 and then on up and thinking that the 50 cents is by right now and I'll buy right administrative.
That takes care of a lot of your private users.
Then if you go from 50 to 100, since that's going to be CUP and they have to come in experience in the past, we've seen that these towers bring the neighbors out and a lot of times they get postponed.
And we end up having tableings and that's why the 750 was considered not enough because we're going to pay for double the advertising and whatnot. So it was more appropriate for 1500.
If you went over 100, well, then you definitely into the realm of commercial.
And we didn't seem to need to lower that fee since we may have to have legal involved or studies. We needed we needed that buffer just as we always have.
So we use the 100 foot is kind of the cutoff between private and commercial.
And the history is any guide our last couple of self tower meetings have been two or three meetings and a lot of.
Yeah, and the cost of the county advertising and things will certainly more than a standard CEP.
Thank you. Anyone else?
Here's your jewel.
It comes back to personal use versus commercial use, whether it's a small company or it's an individual.
The argument's been take it down to 750 for individuals.
I think it's got to be written accordingly because we've had small businesses like when I was mentioned tonight that's abuse this and they're continuing to abuse this.
And they're going to continue to abuse this, especially if you're dropping the CUP price.
And I think it's got to be the tiered idea, especially for the individuals.
That was the argument and that's been the concern all along.
We've been in and many of these meetings both in the planning commission and with the supervisors and the arguments been that folks can't get internet.
They want to have the right to put a tower up.
That's good if it's for the individual.
But when it becomes a commercial, that's when it's been a real problem, especially when the commercial is not companies not abiding the rules and regulations and just ignoring us, ignoring the rights.
So I think that the 1500 gives you an idea, but I really would love to hear how many are actual individuals that only want it for them versus a company is coming in buying a house.
Running the house out and putting a tower up and then all of a sudden you got a commercial tower there.
I think it's a real problem that's got to be addressed and it's got to be addressed so it's tight.
While we have the opportunity to write these rules.
Thank you, Mr. Gil.
Appreciate it.
Anyone else?
Mr. Morrison.
I think we're using the height of the tower wrongly in this case because especially in the western part of the county where people are in a mountainous area.
I know I'm not intending to put up a tower, but I live along with South of Creek.
I'm in a hole and 100 foot tower wouldn't do me any good no matter how I intended to use it.
And there's only three neighbors.
So it's not going to be a commercial enterprise.
I know there's a lot of people in a similar situation.
So if we only regulate according to the height of the tower, we will be unjust to some people and yet allow some other people to get away with it.
And I think we need a balance of those two things as well.
Thank you, sir.
Anyone else?
All good discussion.
You have what you need, Mr. Klein.
Sir, we do.
Thank you.
I think it's going to be ongoing for a little while.
So thank you.
Next item is also an information discussion item.
It's zoning enforcement violations and penalties.
Mr. Klein.
Yes.
Good evening again.
This is another ordinance amendment for information discussion purposes regarding zoning enforcement, violation and penalties.
Specifically, this is a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance to enact stricter penalties for zoning violations.
Presently, the county enforces zoning ordinance violations through the misdemeanor process.
But the state also permits the use of civil penalties.
If the county adopted civil penalties for specific violations, state law would require the county to pursue civil penalties for those violations up to an accumulated fine limit of $5,000.
That's for pursuing the misdemeanor process for those violations.
The Development Regulations Review and Regulations Committee discussed this item on February the 27th as well.
And the DRC, after consultation with the county attorney, generally supported increasing the fees under the current misdemeanor process, rather than enacting a civil penalty process.
Sent forward to the planning commission for discussion.
So again, the DRC supported the county attorney's recommendation to increase the fees for misdemeanors as opposed to enacting civil penalties.
Again, this ordinance amendment is presented this evening for information discussion and comments from the planning commission discussion will be presented to the board of supervisors.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Klein. Anyone like to discuss enforcement of zoning violations and penalties, a hot topic for Mr. Williams.
I think we had good guidance and good insight from Mr. Williams.
I think that I think everyone is in agreement coming off the DRC that this is the right way to go.
There's no one having a further discussion, I think.
Mr. Thomas, I agree with you.
And I think we ought to go with whichever is the highest cost penalty and the easiest for the county to collect.
What else?
Thank you, Mr. Klein.
We've come down to that famous part of our meeting. It's called other.
I think I can safely say we have no meeting scheduled for May 20th.
That is correct.
That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
We will be having a meeting on June 3rd.
Obviously during the current condition, we want to make sure that we're minimizing the meetings as much as possible.
But you do have items to deal with and therefore we will be meeting on June 3rd and likely after that too.
And until further notice, this will be our setup until someone tells us otherwise.
I appreciate everyone's cooperation tonight.
It's a little different that I get to look at people.
I'm sorry again, Mr. Jewel, for missing you early on.
But I'll make that up down the road to you.
With that, I'll entertain a motion to adjourn.
So moved.
Second.
Second, all those in favor.
All right.
We're adjourned.
Thank you.
