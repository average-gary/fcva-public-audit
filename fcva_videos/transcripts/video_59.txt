Do you have one tonight from Frederick Water, Mr. Marston?
Yes.
Thank you very much.
There you go.
The Frederick Water Board of Directors met on last night, actually,
18th of all, it was the 5th.
First on the agenda, they denied a swaza exception request for a
sensiny place.
The Frederick Water Board of Directors denied the swaza accepting request
for a sensiny place.
The developers' a sensiny place requested the exception to enable use of
city of Winchester Water and developers' a sensiny place service
to serve a proposed 64-unit multi-family development.
The proposed sensiny place development is a redevelopment of the
St. Paul's on the Hill Church site, as you all probably remember.
The site will be leveled, use changed from the church to a
residential use and begin as a new development site.
Very orders, water and service services are in the
vicinity of the development site.
The Frederick Water Board determined that the exemption from utilizing
the services will not warrant it, so they denied that exemption.
Second on the agenda was the authorization, authorize the
assessment of late penalties and resuming disconnection
of delinquent customers.
Frederick Water recognized the impact that COVID-19 has
placed on his customers as suspended late penalties and
disconnection of delinquent accounts in March 2020.
As of August 13, 2020, there were over 1,200 delinquent accounts
with unpaid bills holding over $229,000.
Customers have been and continue to be encouraged to contact
Frederick Water's consumer services to enter into a payment
plan should they be unable to pay that bi-monthly water and
sewer bills.
On August 18, 2020, the Board agreed to resume assessments of
late penalties on delinquent accounts beginning September
1 of 2020.
The Board also agreed to a immediately resumed disconnection of
commercial customers with delinquent accounts.
And the Board authorized resuming disconnections of delinquent
residential customers beginning with the next cycle of bills
distributed August 31 of 2020.
Customers are encouraged to pay their bills and full by the due dates.
Residential customers are unable to pay their bill to contact
customer service to enter into a payment plan and avoid
disconnection of water and sewer services.
July Operations Report, customer base now with Frederick Water
is over 16,900 connections.
Monthly water production averaged 7.54 million gallons per day.
The cores are full and in excellent shape.
Water production, James H. Dill Plant, 3.3 million gallons per day,
James T. Anderson Plant, 3.2 million gallons per day,
City of Winchester.
We've purchased from the City of Winchester just a little bit
over a million gallons per day.
Mark the rainfall for July was 5.51 inches up from June
4.52 inches.
That concludes my report.
Thank you, sir.
Don't believe we have any other reports.
So I'll move into Winchester planning.
No liaisons.
I'll give a quick update on what our neighbors have been doing.
They had a request this from the August 18th meeting,
which was yesterday they had a request for conditional use permit

They approved an ordinance amending the zoning ordinance pertaining

And last, they had an ordinance to vacate and convey an estimated
2,000 square feet roughly portion of center street.
Jason to 1.52 Fox Drive.
That was table to September 15th.
So they were busy on the other side of the street also.
Our last one is I don't see a board supervisor.
Liaison down to the table.
Mr. Wells, I do see you in the crowd.
I don't see you in the crowd tonight or were you just.
I just want to talk with you around.
You're doing a good job as Bob Wells.
We'll continue on from there.
Thank you, sir, for attending tonight.
Next item on our agenda is our citizen comment portion.
Anyone that would like to come before the commission to speak to
any matters not on our agenda or not one of the items in the
public hearings can come forward at this time and speak to us.
Seeing no one coming forward on the citizen comments, I do see
Mr. Chair and coming forward with our first public hearing item,
which is a conditional use permit number 06-20 for Darren Hockton.
Mr. Chair.
Commissioner Chairman.
Members of the planning commission.
This is a conditional use permit for a 84th telecommunication
facility. The property is located on darkwood trail trail and
Shawnee land.
It's in the back creek mad cereal district.
This is a request again to construct a 84th commercial
telecommunication facility.
The property is located in Shawnee land, which is currently
zoned out of five.
It's surrounded by our five zone properties that are vacant.
The property owner, and this is one of our first thought,
Mr. Chairman, we changed our ordinance last year for
have small cells.
This applicant actually was the first one that brought in had a
small cell telecommunications hire, which has approved the
administratively by staff.
However, the proposed conditional use permit will allow to
increase to 30 feet, provide for service up there,
Shawnee land, and that's why it's in front of you today for review.
Frederick County zoning ordinance allows the commercial telecommunications
facility in the R5 zoning district with an approved conditional use permit.
This facility should this be approved, the commercial telecommunications
facility.
We position to provide existing and future land uses in this area with
wireless telecommunications.
I think it turned again your attention to map on your left.
There's outlier where the property is located.
And again, there's a 50 foot tire up there currently.
It was approved by Frederick County.
I had a building permit also.
Again, the applicant, because the ordinance requires if you're
on a 50 feet that come in front of the board of this board and the board
supervisors.
In the aerial photograph of the area.
I should the planning commission find this used to be appropriate.
Staff will recommend the following conditions be assigned to this condition of use
permit.
Number one, all review agencies and comments shall be applied with it all times.
Number two, the tire should be available for co-location of wireless services.
Number three, the tire should be removed by the applicant or property owner
with in 12 months of abandonment.
Number four, any expansion or modification of this use require a new
conditional use permit.
Mr. Chairman, following the public hearing.
With staff seeking a recommendation from the planning commission.
The forward to the board of supervisors on this request for conditional use
permit.
The record Mr. Darryl Hoffman, who actually has this application and the next one is
here to answer any questions you or any planning commissioners may have on this
request.
Obviously, I'll be here to answer any questions also.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Any questions from Mr. Chairman?
Good panoramic.
Thank you.
Would the applicant like to speak to us tonight?
Thank you.
That's quite all right.
This time we'll open the public hearing.
Anyone would like to come and speak before us on this matter before or
against and come forward now that public hearing is open?
And seeing no ones come forward, I'll close the public hearing.
Is there any discussion amongst the commissioners questions for anyone?
Not I'll entertain a motion from the back creek district.
Either Mr. Marston or Jewel.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a motion that we approve.
The senior P number of six, 106-20 for the tower.
Do I have a second?
Second.
And we'll do a vote.
How about start with Mr. Klan?
And road to yes.
Jewel yes.
Marston yes.
Manual yes.
Odes yes.
Turn to yes.
Mone yes.
Thousand yes.
More than yes.
Boldly yes.
Chair votes yes.
It is approved.
The conditional express approval goes to the board supervisor for the September 9th meeting.
And I'll go right on into our next public hearing item.
It's conditional use permit number 07-20 also for Darren Hawkeman.
Mr. Chair.
Thank you again, Mr. Chairman.
And this is a conditional use permit submitted to our construction of a hundred foot commercial telecommunication facility.
The property is located at 201.
There's a onto road in Middleton.
And it's in a back creek Magistral district.
The property is currently zoned R.A. in rural areas.
It's surrounded by residential and vacant properties.
This is a request for CUP to construct a hundred foot commercial telecommunication facility for internet wireless.
The property is currently nine acres and again it's zoned R.A.
The comprehensive policy plan identifies this area of the county to remain rural and natural and not part of any land you study at this time.
This conditional use permit was applied for responsible complaint staff received regarding this hundred foot lattice commercial telecommunication facility on a property without an approved conditional use permit.
The approved conditional use permit is one avenue to abate the violation.
The zoning order is the last telecommunication facilities in the R.A. zoning district or approved conditional use permit.
Should this facility be approved the commercial this commercial telecommunication facility will be positioned to provide the existing and future land use is this area to county with internet wireless needs.
I can turn your attention to the map on your left.
There's the online or the tower currently is located.
Should the planning commission find this used to be appropriate staff would recommend the following conditions be assigned to the conditional use permit.
Number one, our review agency comments should be applied with it all times.
Number two, tires should be available for co-location of personal wireless service providers.
Number three, the tires shall be removed by the applicant or property owner within 12 months of abandonment of operation.
Number four, any expansion or modification is used to require conditional use permit.
Mr. Chairman, again, Mr. Darren Hawkman here to represent this application.
I'll be happy to answer any questions you or any planning commissioners may have on this proposed conditional use permit.
Thank you.
Any questions from Mr. Chairman on this side?
Thank you. I assume that Mr. Hawkman is going not to speak again.
You would like to speak for this one or?
Okay, thank you, sir.
Sorry, we do have a question.
In the item number 10, where lists all the adjacent property owners, there's just one property owner listed.
There's one property owner own, all the property surrounding this.
That is correct.
Okay.
All right, this is a public hearing.
At this time, I'll open a public hearing.
Anyone that would like to come before us and speak for against this item, please come forward to the podium.
Seeing no one, I'll close the public hearing.
And is there any discussions, questions further?
Hearing none, I'll entertain a motion again from the back creek district.
We make a motion.
I request we make a motion to approve this CUP number 07-20 for the tower.
Do I have a second?
Second.
Thank you.
I'll start with Mr. Mullen over here at this time.
Mullen, yes.
Morrison, yes.
Oh, yes.
Purple, yes.
Oh, miss, yes.
Oh, yes.
Manuel, yes.
Arstin, yes.
Jewel, yes.
Bogey, yes.
Car, yes.
The chair votes, yes.
This is CUP as approved and goes to the Board Supervisors also on the September 9th meeting date.
Zippin, right along.
Our next one is another conditional use permit, 09-20 for a Richard ensues and daughtery.
And Mr. Chairman is still here.
Yep, still here.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This could be used permit before you tonight is for a 100-foot commercial telecommunications facility.
This property is located at 348 P. per lane.
And it is the Gainesville Magisterial District.
The property is also zoned R.A.
Property surrounding it is zoned R.A.
And the land use is residential and vacant respectively.
This is a request for conditional use permit to construct a 100-foot telecommunications facility.
This proposed new tower is intended to replace the existing 90-foot tire that was constructed without a proof conditional use permit.
The prop, this is another violation that staff had received and clear the evade the violation was as while we're here tonight for the conditional use permit.
This area, the comprehensive policy plan identifies this area of the county to remain rural nature and is not part of any land use study.
Again, it's pointed out, Mr. Chairman, this wasn't through a violation.
The applicant has also secured a recorded tire easement, which I'll show you, because as you will aware of, for every foot you go up, you have to fall ratio.
That falls down on the buildings or within the property line.
When this tire was constructed a number of years ago, it was close to the property line.
And I think your packet also shows the easement that the authorities actually got from the adjoining property owner.
So it satisfies that part of the orders or requires on our high exemptions.
So this telecommunication facility would be approved.
It would serve and provide existing telecommunications and future land.
Uses in the county would also have internet access from the record, Mr. Chairman, staff and I think it's your.
Dias did receive three layers of support from surrounding neighbors of this conditional use permit for internet service in this part of the county.
I think it's a map and there's the kind of layout of where the property is.
This isn't a rule subdivision that was created a number of years ago.
The properties outlined as you see in blue.
This is the fall ratio with the what they did for the easement.
That I explained earlier about the, you know, to meet our fall ratio of one for every foot you go up on foot of the ratio.
The commission find this used to be appropriate.
The record staff recommends a following conditions to be assigned to this conditional use permit.
Number one, all review agencies shall be comply with it all times.
Number two, the tires should be available for co-locating or personal wireless service providers.
Number three, the tires should be removed by the applicant or popular within 12 months of abandonment.
The, the, the, the applicant has secured a record of tire easement on the adjoining property for the purposes of the required setback fall area for the tire.
So this tower easement been vacated.
The tire should be removed within 30 days.
I'm notification by the county unless the applicant can demonstrate through documentation from a Virginia certified engineer that tire will collapse.
In a contained area around the tower with equal.
A radius equals, excuse me, or lesser to the setback as major from the center line on the base of the telecommunication facility.
Now again, Mr. Chairman, with that easement, it still means that fall ratio.
Why this condition was added is, as pointed out, should the easement and the new property will come in plot to easement.
They're going to have to know the fight of county will have to go up and take a look at it and see if they meet that ratio.
If they don't, then the condition will use permit.
They won't be able to meet the one of the conditions, as we always put on here, all conditions should be applied by or followed.
And finally, any expense or modification of the issues required in the condition of use permit.
If the record authorities actually moved into this.
Residents, the tire was there prior to the moving in.
Like I said, they got caught up and we did receive a complaint.
So in fairness to it, I don't think they won't hear or represent them.
But in fairness, that's what they got caught up in.
And that's why we're here.
So with that, Mr. Chairman, I'll answer any questions that you were running the planning commission.
May I have on this condition to use permit?
Any questions, Mr. Chairman?
Seeing none, I don't believe.
Thank you.
And you say the applicant is not here?
That is correct.
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
So public hearing.
Anyone would like to come before us?
I'll open the public hearing at this time.
And if anybody would like to come before us and speak to this matter, please come to the podium.
And seeing no one, I'll close the public hearing.
And there are any discussions or questions?
Seeing none.
This is a Gainesboro District.
Mr. Tripley.
Yes.
I make a motion to approve conditional use permit 09-20.
Oh, second.
Second.
About a second.
And vote.
We'll start over.
How about starting this Dawson over here this time?
We'll go across the back of the room.

turbo- Jess.
ints year.

Hong.

� Yes.
The service permit is approved.
There goes also the board approvals it was on September 9th.
Mr. Chairman again is before us were 4th, with a conditional use permit and number .
08-20 .
A picture.
Now, Mr. Chairman, this condition of use permit before you is for establishment of a special event facility in the RA Roya zoning district
The property is located on 1147 North Piper Road star tannery is a back-week match to your district
The zoning of the property is RA the surrounding properties are also zone to RA and they are residential and vacant respectively
This is a request for a condition of use permit again for a special event facility
The property is owned RA and it's surrounded by residential and rural land use
In it's also vacant
The facility will be
Conducted on a hundred and seven-acre existing form which includes a single fat family detached residents in
Outdoor patio and a 24-hundred square foot pawn for weddings and other events
This is our line of the property of Lord Piper Road
This application for the special events facility was applied for a response to a zoning violation
We're operating a special event facility on the property without an approved conditional use permit
The approval of the conditional use permit by the board of supervisors again is one avenue to obey this violation
This condition of use permit
What is what establish a special event facility for private events such as waiting and other similar types of events
Such as birthday parties chair events and family reunions
The special event facility is permitted in our a zoning district as you're well aware of what the conditional use permit
The zoning ordinance defines our special
Events permits not not going to read that way up pretty much know what they are
This proposed use will take place on again is a hundred and seven-acre
Form which includes the single family residents
Open outdoor patio and a 24-hundred square foot barn in the future the applicant is requesting to add
Archer struck 10 to 12 guest cabins to be used in conjunction with special events facilities
Three to four pavilion gazebo and conjunction with special event facilities these additions
Will be shown on an approved side plan engineered side plan
They get applicant attends to host events
Up to 250 people per persons and she'll provide a gravel parking area for guests
Parameter restroom facilities arts will be installed including a new septic system and drain field any food preparation
I will be via a catered companies and there will be a future
Permanent cooking facility special event
Facility will be accessed by a private drawaway from the North Piper road. Mr. Chairman
I if I can just to add and speaking with the applicant obviously he's here
He got in contact contact with staff when we were working with the applicant
Abvate this violation a couple things had come up a little history. I think if I know mr. Jewel was at the board of supervisors
Meeting last Wednesday that they had a applied for a
Special event or festival forbidding for their special event
The applicant was cited back last October actually his work with staff diligently
Of course, we know what happened in March until they can get the review agencies out here to look at one of the review agencies
Was the Department of Transportation at the time and which we'll have as you spread near
The staff report there's some new entrances and things will be addressed furthermore
What the applicant had asked at the time was looking at their future as you know additional use permits
It's one shop for like a better or one kill you try to get everything in one if not you have to come back in front of this board
The applicant actor had asked about the cabins
Staff have generated that in the staff report. However on on Monday
They got in contact with staff and as requested that the cabins would not be part of the conditional use permit
And what that would do is take that off
That's why we have an engineered site plan as you're well aware of when we do special events facilities
It's been in front of this body and also in front of the board of supervisors. We normally require a
generalized plan or sketch plan
This would be a full engineered site plan like we would normally see if we're doing a commercial
So that takes that out of that equation
So I'll be we'll be adjusting those conditions we move along
But I just want to add that from the email mr. Smith will actually do some more explaining what his business model is
But I just want to make you and the other planning commission is aware that mr. Chairman
Thank you, so um should the planning commission find
This used to be a program staff will recommend the following conditions one all review agency comment should we comply with it all times
Now these are original movie to riddle into the records and we get it adjusted as we need
I'm number two an engineered site plan in accordance with the requirements of the
Frederick County zoning ordinance
Should be submitted and subject to approval by Frederick County proctor establishment of the special event facility
What was added again was development on this property
for the special events may include the
Born for events a maximum of four pavilions or or gazeboes a maximum of 12 a guest cabinet and gravel parking for gas
And again the applicant has pulled that off so we're probably have to
If the this party feels better mr. Chairman to maybe amend that
um
Number four special events shall start no late no earlier than 8 a.m. And all events and relate activities should be killing that
student conclude by midnight
Number five special events may accommodate up to but not exceed 250 persons number three one monument style
sign of a maximum square
sign area not to exceed 50 square feet and not to exceed 10 feet height will be permitted and of course any
Expans from modification require new conditional use permit. I'm mr. Chairman mr. Sam was Smith
Was representing this and his daughters here too to represent this application staff
Will answer any questions at you or any of the commission's may have and also to craft the
um
Conditions to move forward to the board supervisors for ultimate approval or disapproval. Thank you mr. Chairman
Thank mr. Chairman any questions from mr. Chair mr. Chair
Would you please tell me again? What are you taking off and why are you taking it off?
I didn't quite understand sir with the applicant originally a apply for
Was to have a minimum of 10 to 12 cabins
Associated with the condition or use with the facility that will require an engineered site plan
The applicant has requested that be taken off
And so that will not be part of this application it would be part of a site plan
It would be they would not eliminate him completely. Okay. Thank you
Who else I got mr. Morrison down here mr. Chair if two three years down the road they decide they want to build these 10 cabins
What would be the process they would have to go through?
I'm mr. Morrison they would have to because their managers
I can just no use permit they'd have to come in front of this board the board supervisors
other
Thanks, sir, and I understand the applicant is in the room, but they'd like to come forward in and speak on their behalf
It's two comments one
And talking with the neighbors around said at midnight. We were saying 11 o'clock for close just midnight was too late, you know
As part of the conditions and for concluding of events and
If it all possible like to not have a big gravel parking lot in the
In the farm, but I think that's it for the most part. I think that's mr. Sharon covered it all
Uh, would you mind kind of going down through your whole
You're kind of busy model. So you want to grow this it sounds like so you're starting out with
You had a festival permit in place. I guess that's where we were at and then so now we realize that that's you know
You want to move up to conditional use permit because the violations or what have you so your plan is eventually to have a sprawling type of
Complex out there is that
I think that was pie in the sky a year ago
Well, a lot of said there's a year ago so after going through
covid and uh
Feeling a lot of different hands on my pocket as we go through this process what it takes to get here
I said, you know, I think this is out the window right now
So let's just see what we can do for three to five years and see if we can make this successful first before we go
That's pretty much your business plan is three to five years step back and see where you're at and then go exactly right
Okay, all right. Thank you. Anyone else have a question for the applicants?
All right
Oh got could you come back sir?
Mr. Argy got one question mr. Jewel over here. Mr. Smith. I've got two questions actually. Smith. Sorry
Uh
The the driveway are you you currently are putting a new driveway in
That is correct. We have a permit from v dot for the new driveway and is it going yet before the CUP will it be in place?
Oh, yes. Yes. Okay. No, there it was up. I
I'm in the back weekend. It was up for questions. I wanted to put that the rest that you're going in before the before the ninth of September
Right
That I don't know, but you are putting in yes. Yes. Okay, even with the event
Permanent not the same question was you bet
I guess where the driveway is going
You've got a neighbor or a couple of neighbors that could see headlights and traffic
And the questions come up. Are you willing to put
Trees or something in place if it's necessary. So it doesn't impact your neighbor. Yes
Okay, there's with the two that I was
brought to my attention. So any other questions mr. Smith
Thanks. Thank you both
Good
This is a public hearing on this time I'll put a public hearing him when I come forward to speak before or against
Please come forward state your name your address
Yes, my name is Louise Garrett and I reside in the adjacent property at
99 North Piper Road
I apologize to the commission. I've never been to this meeting before
So I didn't know what I needed a thumb drive
But I bought hard pictures
Of my driveway my driveway and the proposed driveway. I took these this morning mr. Chairman. I'll take them right behind you there. There you go
So
So again, my name is Louise Garrett and I reside at 929 North Piper Road
On mr. Smith's
Actually Northern
Border property
Um our properties
Border actually right where he's going to put his
His new driveway
For four generations my family has enjoyed um
The peace and quiet of our family farm
mr. Smith's new entrance
Will be directly next to mine with the only separation that will be a property boundary
Thin's and I think about 20 so 20 or 30 feet of ground space
um
I was agreeable last week um and uh really promoted it to my neighbors
mr. Smith's festival permit
Because essentially I felt that it gave me and the other um
A neighboring land owners a trial period
Um
As we understand the festival permit is renewed annually and so the community
Could bring any concerns to the table to have uh changes considered
Now week later we hear that there is an application or it's going to be presented to the commission a
Conditional use permit which would be
More permanent um and really could only be revoked were there to be multiple violations
The CUP would also permit a significant increase in uh the events
uh occurring the community was told um by um
Our um supervisor that he he educated some of us um we were told that um
Mr. Smith was looking at 12 to 15 events a year with the um with that particular um
um
Festival permit
Um and it seems probably most of these would occur on weekends
My concerns are as follows
I'm not comfortable uh with the issuance of a CUP right now when he uh hasn't had um when he
Excuse me when he only uh had the festival permit uh for for a week and there have been uh no events
Where guests have used the new entrance um next to mine
Um
There needs to be a trial period a couple of months with multiple and various sizes of events
To get a real uh sense of what it will be like mr
Festival permit allows him to do that um to our understanding and it also allows the community to make a
better um assessment of the impact uh to our um placid lifestyle
I do not have uh really any idea what kind of noise pollution or light pollution um there may be
We just don't know um you know with mr. Smith's um new um entrance of course
I would be the most impacted because it's right beside my driveway
um
But here is what I respectfully request
I respectfully requesting the committee consider uh to delay the CUP for a period of 60 to 90 days um
To accurately determine what if any additional conditions might be needed to um gratify both
Of our needs mr. Smith's and and um myself and in people that that there are other people my besides my self that water
um
The last thing I would like to say you know is that I wish to continue to enjoy my quiet in peace on my family property
Um and my home which I've worked very hard for and um
um
And I would also say that I really want to maintain um, you know good relations with a new neighbor
Um, I have welcomed mr. Smith. He's been very respectful and kind and I look forward to us being neighbors
I just really feel um
That we need to have a little bit of a trial period you look at those pictures um
I think he did start this evening um as somebody told me but um as of this morning you know
Nothing has been done. I don't mean we don't even know what that's going to look like so um
I thank you for your time and consideration. Thank you. Thank you ma'am
Anyone else like to come forward
See you know one I'll close the public hearing and
Go back to any questions for commissioners
I
Anyone
Good. I got mr. Oates. I'll just say the only issue I had with it was the gas cabins potential to turn to a year around campground that since I was taking out
um
Like so that was my biggest concern so I'll just look to the
Plank Emissioners of Back Creek commission
Thank you. Anyone else mr. Joel mr. Chairman again this is opportunity for us to help agriculture
It's a different way of doing it. They know we know that
Farmers are doing what they can to hold on to the property
So you know, I just think it's a it's a nice way of being able to do it
I did ask the question about the tree grove and he's willing to work with that
So if that's you know what they need to do then that's what they'll need to do
So if it didn't it wouldn't take too much time to thank mr. Joel and I'm looking at this aerial photo of the property
And I keep hearing about putting a new driveway in do is there a way that we
Anyone it can show where this?
Act how we're going to be accessing this barn because when I blow it up it looks kind of like it just disappears into the field there
You know where the the applicant it's going to be on the upper
Corn one north there. Okay, so up to the up there where it does connect
Adjacent to 929. That's correct. Okay, so it's going to follow along the tree line there or is it?
uh
If you's the born as a lawyer is probably to come
Um, I don't let the applicant maybe speak to have more than I can
That's where the the entrances there would Vito had looked at
The film currently is being served by an entrance now that
If the CUP would be turned out they could still use
Because the
The the the entrance is put on the upper part of this property
Just because the lower entrance that's already there does not meet sight distance as you've seen in the
And with Vito I read written up pretty much what they're looking at so
That's what we're looking not let him ask her how far down it's going to go mr. Chairman
But I believe that's where and meet with the applicant I can read off. That's kind of what's going to be okay
Smith would you mind showing kind of where you play on putting that driveway or putting the access road to it?
Yes, so we're going to you'll come in the north side and we're going to run parallel back with Piper road
We're going to try and stay as close to those you can because I don't want to mess up my hate fields
As much as possible, then I'm going to basically come right back parallel with Piper road about
30 feet
Off the Piper road and then come down you there's a
Kind of an L-shaped field there. We're going to come down that tree line
To the barn on that side
Yep, thank you
Thomas mr. Chairman, I agree with what mr. Oates and mr. Jules said
I mean we've been looking for ways to try to
Preserve agricultural land and give farmers an opportunity to keep their land and
respecting
Personal property rights. I think this is a good use
And you know as the applicant said he's going to try to parallel Piper road and come down
there. I really don't see that there'll be a lot of
impact to the neighbors and
You know, this isn't an everyday occurrence or they're going to have 250 people there
I mean, maybe they would like to have 250 people there every day
But it's not going to practically happen. So I support this
Thanks, sir anywhere else

Mr. Chairman to make a motion that we approve conditional use permit number 0820 for the use for the special events
Facility we also need to include in there and I thank for your motion

Guest cabins for these removed 12 cabins or guest houses however

It's been corrected. So it will be able to be no later than 11 o'clock. Okay
So we're seconded. Do we need to remove number two the engineered site plan?
Yes, you would need to make a motion or amend it for a
To remove the engineered site plan because the cabins are going away. So make it up for most of what we use is a sketch plan
The lesser sketch plan like we've done before
Can you say a man what?
We're going to remove the engineered site site plan. Okay number two
