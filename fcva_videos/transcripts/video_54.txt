Thank you.
This time, the first item on our
agenda is the adoption to the
agenda, but we do have a change
tonight.
We, the item number six on our
agenda under public hearings is
the second item that we will
be going to move from our agenda
tonight, we have it that will be
tentatively scavery scheduled
for this first September meeting
that we have.
We will allow the citizens that
did show up because it's such
late notice.
We all got it late this afternoon,
the citizens that did show up to
want to speak during the public
hearing will be allowed to speak
during our citizen comment
portion.
I'll address that when we get
there.
It will be the second item in the
citizen comment portion.
We will move to the second item
that we are going to move to.
No, sir.
We don't have.
Six b six b.
I'll reach over to Mr. Williams
for an explanation on where we
stand on this.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Item six b, the Barton'sville
Energy Facility item.
We were still looking at some
information and kind of late in
the process.
This week, discovered a couple
of issues that still need to be
held.
This is all, particularly regarding
the road rights of way that are
implicated by that.
Staff need some more time to work
on that and is talked to the
applicant.
It is unhold as Mr. Chairman,
you indicated.
As you indicated, obviously,
since it was late notice,
citizen comment will be received
and made part of the record for
consideration of the
to come back when it has come up for the public when it does come up for the
public hearing presumably in September. Okay. Thank you sir. So this town
I entertain a motion to to adopt the agenda with those changes that were
removal of item 6B from the Knights agenda. All those in favor? All right. Thank
you. Gender is adopted. Next item is our meeting minutes. Need them. Is
everyone's read the meeting minutes from our May 6th, 2020 meeting. If so
if there's no changes to those minutes I'll accept a motion to approve. All
those in favor? Meeting minutes are approved from May 6th, 2020. Our next item
on our agenda is our committee reports since I think we've had a few meetings
since we have blessed gathered so first one I have is transportation Mr.
Roots. Yes, we met this past Monday June 29th had just a couple of
items on the agenda. The first was a rattle 11 North exit 317 study. V dots
come up with a diverging diamond layout for rattle 11. It's gonna be
interesting to see how the citizens receive that but it does solve a lot of
issues. So we discussed that V dots moving forward with that study. The smart
scale resolution we approved that as form however with the COVID crisis
everything's kind of been put on the back burner V dot a lot of deadlines are
getting pushed back so that's not going forward quite yet. We also had a
discussion of our interstate primary and secondary road plans while the
interstate and primary road plans we did endorse those. The secondary road
plans we could not because they're still waiting on V dot to come back with
information mainly how much money that is going to be available they don't
have that information yet and then under project updates Renaissance Drive is
still being worked on that plans at 90% and today the software springs road
project had its final inspection. I've not heard whether or not it passed but if
it did then that project is completed. Thanks sir. Next time is our DRC
top of review committee meeting. The DRRC committee met on Thursday June 25th
and 7th the only item discussed was a proposed met ordinance amendment to
expand the definition of daycare facility to include adult care and all those
presidents seem very enthusiastic about it. And it'll come before you all in
August. Okay. Thank you Mr. Merge. Next item the next we have is Frederick
Water Mr. Marston. Thank you Mr. Chairman the Frederick Water Board of
Directors met on June the 16th 2025 PM with a few agenda items. One was
adopting a pandemic policy which has been implemented over the past few
months in response to COVID-19. The policies address treatment plan and
water and serve distribution land operators. The policy ensures employees safety
while operating efficiently and cursly to provide Frederick Water's essential
services. I think they as it says they have been implementing this for quite
some time and it just made it a policy. Next item was others eyes the execution
of a construction contract for new water treatment plant. The Board authorizes
a construction contract with orders construction to construct the new 8 million
gallon per day. Harry F. Sawisky water treatment plant adjacent to the Stonewall
Park. The plant will utilize the adjacent 3 billion gallon. That's with a B. 3
billion gallon commerce quarries and the Peck and Creek as a raw water source
and storage. Next item was the Orchard View Elementary School water system and
production well improvements are complete. At this point that well the
production well is now delivering raw water to the Dell water treatment plant
and treated potable water is being returned to the school building. So that is
a completed project. The May Operations Report customer bases over 17,000
connections. The monthly water production and average is 6.2 million gallons per
day. The cores are full and excellent shape at this time but I don't know
what's happening with the dry weather. The water production James A. Steele plant put
2.8 million a million gallons per day. James T. Anderson plant 3.1 million gallons
per day. Now the city of Winchester 0.492 million gallons per day. So what it says is
a water purchase from the city of Winchester has been reduced historically over
historically over 2 million gallons a day well that we were getting and is now
down to 0.492 million less than a half a million gallons and of course this is
a significant cost saving so to the federal county customers. The rainfall on May
was 2.01 inches down from April for four and a half inches and that concludes your
mind report. Thank you Mr. Marston appreciate that. Next one on there is our
agricultural district Mr. Klein. Excuse me the agriculture district advisory committee met June 25th to 2020.
Every five years for every county is required to evaluate ad renew remove properties from
the agriculture or industrial district. Following review by the A.D.A.C. Board of
Supervisors the Board of Supervisors will then approve approved with modifications or
deny the proposal. We have two new districts coming in the new and its
new district. Thank you Mr. Chairman and I would like to make a couple of comments for myself being one of the board of Supervisors.
I'd like to personally thank Mr. Klein and Mr. Mike Roddy from the planning commission for the work they've done over the past several months with a lot of
different tower events that have come forward. They've put forth a lot of work and I'd like to publicly thank them. The other thing I would like to do is publicly thank Mr.
Jewel and Mr. Marston from my district. I know that the work that they've put in has been a lot more than maybe they anticipated over the last
several months. I've appreciated their willingness to meet. I've appreciated their professional courtesy that they've extended to the
citizens and I really want to give a public shout out to the hard work they've done so thank you. Thank you for the comments.
I appreciate it. That closes and I don't think we had a CPPC and that closes our committee reports. The next one is our citizen comment portion and we'll do this and kind of split this in two phases.
What I'll do the first is anyone that wants to make a comment come before the board planning commission with anything that's not on our agenda keeping in mind that we've
approved the one item. So at this time anyone has something that's not on this agenda that we see this is your time to come forward and speak. I will make an
announcement them for the second part will be for the one item for the Bartonsville energy facility will come forward at that time. So did anyone have
anything that's not related to the Bartonsville? Okay. If not at this time then I'll let citizens come forward and speak to us regarding the Bartonsville energy
facility. Keep your comments brief to eight three minutes and I've got a gentleman with us hand up back there. Come on up. Please state your name and match jail district like we always
require. We'll go from there. I live in Shen County, but we'll let you speak. My name is Stephen Bram. I'm one of the owners of a parcel of Springdale Glen subdivision the
Carrollton and States, which we've had approved many years ago. We are very hopeful that this project of solar project will go for it. I know it's you're going to get extended time to think about it. We've worked with Frederick water and Eric Lawrence and the
lines coming through to the school and middle road. So we'd like to save taxpayers money. The developments would impact roads, public safety and other services, including the Department of Highways when the roads are dedicated and given over to them.
So I'm going to read to you something we put together. As owners of Kelton State and Springdale Glen, we look forward to the approval of the torch solar facility. Recently the Fox Globe solar project was passed and we feel similar, similar decision is evident for the same reasons as indicated that hearing. Our land is well located for a solar farm.
We've included not near any major subdivisions. Sores of passive use of the property, which does not require any new county services, roads, schools, utilities, etc.
A subdivision be more active and burn some usage for the county. The project will contribute taxes and revenue to the county. And as
Lane Brunback was quoted as saying, and when the Fox Globe solar project came up, with being more difficult to fees we farm, the land is being used and not developed, dotted with houses.
Solar equipment can be removed. Houses would not. This type of use would maintain the peacefulness and integrity of our natural landscape.
Solar is a clean and efficient energy source, which is an option being promoted in our current economic interest. Thank you for your time and interest sir.
Anyone else.
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to speak if I may.
From the back creek districts as the board of supervisors for the for the district and as many of the folks who have reached out to me from the previous solar project that we dealt with may know what comes before you guys this evening isn't always what is approved or passed.
So I would simply like to take this moment to reach out to all the folks who came here tonight to listen to what was said and maybe even to speak to say that I have an open year.
And I'd like to hear from you. I have reached out to over 40 folks from the previous solar project in both Mr. Jewel and Mr. Marston went with me to many of those contacts and as I've previously stated what was finally approved wasn't exactly what was originally submitted.
So I would welcome your feedback. I'd like to hear from you and I look forward to our interaction in the future. Thank you very much.
Anyone else.
Anyone else.
See you know what else. I'll close the citizen comment.
We'll move on into our public hearing our first public hearing item.
For CUP is number zero four dash twenty for Robert Blankenship telecommunications tower. Mr. Chairman.
This is a conditional use permit for a seventy foot commercial telecommunications tower and let me get the screen up for you.
Okay, one had our to trail a lot to fifteen and a shiny land manager or excuse me, shiny land subdivision in the back great district.
The this is a request again for a district use permit for a seventy foot telecommunications tower.
The property is located in our five zoning district was which is a residential recreational community and the land use is vacant.
So running this proposed tower.
Turn your attention to the map to your left.
Outline is the parcel where this telecommunications tie already exists and shows you the land and shown a land with the plot.
Now this conditional use permit was applied for for in response to a zoning violation due to a construction of the telecommunications tower for Internet access to be communication on this property without an approved conditional use permit.
The approval of this conditional use permit should the board approve it and you pass along will alleviate the violation currently on the property.
The zoning orders allow for commercial telecommunications facilities in your five zoning district with an approved conditional use permit.
This facility would if approved excuse me would allow for existing and future land uses to have Internet in this subdivision.
This is the layout that was already here and I just just understand that the applicant was cited had constructed a tire and a tire actually was constructed some time ago.
And the applicant is also here you can speak on that the applicant came in after got the notice of violation from staff apply for the conditional use permit.
And this can clean our conditional use permit will clean the violation up would note as the changes that we've had with the 50 foot small cell.
He's a little bit over that at 70 so that's why we're here for the conditional use permit tonight.
I should the planning commission find this. I used to be appropriate staff would recommend the following conditions be assigned to it one.
Our review agency comments should be applied with the old times to the tires should be available for a co-location wireless service providers.
Three that the tire shall be removed by the applicant property within 12 months of abandonment of operation and number four any expense for modification required new conditional use permit.
The record was blank ships here to answer any questions you were or the planning commissioners may have and again staff is here to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Any questions, Mr. Chair?
No one. Thank you. Would the applicant like to come forward please Mr. Blankenship?
Yes, sir.
Any sir.
To make any comments.
Yes, sir. We acquired this tower from a previous owner.
I'd originally been extracted 95. We were under the belief that everything was in accordance with county at that time.
And found out when Mr. Chair contacted us it was not so we're simply trying to come into compliance with the county to be a good neighbor here providing a source of wireless communications for Internet within the community there.
Questions, Mr. Blankenship?
Come around the panoramic view that I have these days over here.
The design of this tower. What kind of what's the structure of it?
It's known as a roll 25G or guide tower.
10 foot sections.
It's a guide actually we have additional going above the standard by the manufacturer to reinforce against torquing with the high winds up there.
This time of very stable tower. We're using three sixteenth EHS cable on it.
Guide to manufacturers, but our attention is given to manufacturer specifications.
And if the for any reason a tower where the fall it would fall entirely on your property.
Yes, sir. A terrorist type typically falls in a cell instead of falling over like this.
That's where it is.
The other questions.
Thank you, sir.
This is a public hearing.
This time I'll open a public hearing by wish to speak to this matter.
May come forward.
State your name.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman William Murphy. Can you guys hear me with the mask on?
Okay.
So.
In 2005, the county did a lot of advertising.
Because it had a lot of residential property that it wanted to sell.
And here's one of the official announcements from the auctioneer from the Winchester sale.
Government land for sale November 12, 2005 nestled in the breathtaking Shenandoah Valley.
Lies Winchester Frederick County, a scenic locale steeped in heritage from pre-colonial times to modern day history makers.
Bustling with charm Frederick County's proximity to the metropolitan area gives our community the best of both worlds.
Take advantage of a slower pace and lower cost of living while being in the heart of history and natural beauty.
Now.
Yes, I have copies for everyone.
I just move forward to the microphone.
So you guys advertise this and then the news picked it up even in Fairfax County.
And so I drove out from Fairfax County and I did that again today.
And you're driving out.
You know, you see clusters of antenna.
But you don't just see random antennas are coming up on the ridge.
But I ended up buying it along with.
Any of the three hundred forty other people three hundred seventy six people who bought the lot.
Under the impression that this was going to be residential.
And so finally this year I put the properties up for sale.
There's actually people interested in archwood trail.
They're trying to, according to my real estate agent.
Get some funding together and I have different blocks of lots.
So I've seventeen lots total of the twelve are affected by the tower.
And the blue X might not be in the right spot, but I've got this block of four.
And then during two thousand and five to get that block of four because it was very.
Popular.
I had to pay almost ten thousand dollars a lot back in two thousand and five.
So I got a block of two on archwood and the intent was actually to move up here.
I didn't work out with the job in schools.
And so now we had decided to sell them all.
And I think that the value of the property is really going to go down with that.
And I think the county has like an obligation to the people who bought the land from the government.
Thinking that it was going to be residential to keep it residential.
Thank you sir.
Thank you.
I think anyone else.
So the public hearing anyone else would like to speak to or for the matter.
Seeing no one I'll close the public hearing.
Discussion questions.
Commissioners.
Not this is a back creek district.
Seeing no one.
I'll entertain a motion.
Is my back creek or go ahead.
I make motion that we approve this.

The other one was taken off of our list.
Our next item on our agenda is our other.
Our famous other meeting is when we will have next meeting be Mr. Perkins.
We don't know if we got one.
And I think we're going to cancel the one in July.
The second one in July.
Correct.
We don't have anything scheduled for your July 15th meeting.
So we'll get a notice on a cancellation of that.
And if there's nothing else to come before the planning commissioner's time, I'll seek a motion to adjourn.
So moved.

I got a second.
All those in favor?
