Sir Chairman?
Yes, sir.
I would like to ask to make.
In Redbud, there has been a consistent reminder regarding the spotted landern fly.
As you know, that is an insect that came from China.
It can cause great devastation to not only maple trees, but orchards, peach trees, peach trees, etc.
So I'm going to bring some information to the board at our November meeting on this.
I would like to consider it to be the hotspot in Virginia.
So we need to be aware of that.
And my comments here, just the farmers are aware of that.
We will address that issue in a couple of weeks.
Number two, the volunteer fire and rescue association.
Thanks you, all of you, for your agreement to go and release some funding for the operations.
That's very helpful to them during this COVID time.
So I want you to know that they appreciate the actions we took a couple of weeks ago.
Number three, we're in a national election.
And I think that in future elections, everybody should vote on election day.
This early voting, I don't think it's appropriate.
Everybody should have the same information at the same time to vote, except for those people that are in a hospital.
We're truly cannot.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Other comments, anyone?
Here you go.
We'll move on.
Thank you, sir.
A recognition of Millbook Cross Country team.
That's supervisor done.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So I'm going to take a couple of minutes and show you some pictures of Millbrook High School.
And a cross-country race.
That's the last one.
Go to the beginning.
And so in the area behind Millbrook High School, there's an area that is used by Millbrook High School.
It's a cross-country course.
There's competition there.
And here's part of this course that if you are a runner on a team, you're going to be very familiar with.
And at this point in time, you've come to a middle field.
And that middle field in 1864, which today is part of the cross-country team, was a killing field.
And I'll make some comments on that.
These are placards that are on that field.
This is the middle field from the Confederate perspective on monument to those from Alabama.
And the finish line, if you're running a race.
So what does the middle field mean to you?
The welcome fields behind Millbrook, the middle field, redbudrun.
The Millbrook High School cross-country team, this is their course.
In 2013, the men's cross-country team won the district and regional titles and finished second in the state championships.
In 2014, they repeated winning the district and regional titles and placed fifth.
In 2018 and 2019, the women's team won the district titles and finished third in the state championships.
Drew Hunter from Loudon Valley High School knows this course very well.
He ran the fastest time in Virginia history of 1421 on this course.
Wayne Kendall from Heritage High School, also knows this course well.
And she set a state record for women with a time of 1629.
Between 2017 and 2019, this had more than this course, had more than 2,000 registered athletes each year.
And last year, 2019, there was 2,164 athletes alone representing 49 teams that competed in an invitational meet.
In 2013, Kevin Shirk, the Millbrook High School cross-country coach, started these successful invitational meets.
Between then and last year, they've raised more than $35,000 of these meets and donated to the money to the Shenandoah Valley Battlefield Foundation.
Several other people made contributions to these operations as well.
They include Chris Garber, he's a former athletic director at Millbrook High School, Scott Mankins, the current athletic director and current cross-country coach.
Matthew Lofton, the former assistant coach at Millbrook High School, and numerous amounts of parents, teachers, employees and athletes who have donated their time and effort to help the meet run smoothly, everything from setting up the meet, to cutting the grass, to helping in the parking lot, to collecting their nations.
Who else is familiar with these paths of red-budden run in the middle field? Let me give you some other names.
General Philip Sheraton, General Jubil Early, Colonel George Patton, the grandfather of General George Patton, General Robert Rhodes, who generally considered to be the best officer in his army other than Stonewall Jackson.
And future presidents, Rutherby Hayes, and William McKinley.
Hang on a second.
All those men are familiar with this ground. All of them participated in the Third Battle of Winchester, which was fought here on September 19th, 1864.
Union forces lost 5,000 men, almost 12% of their army, Confederate forces lost 3600 men, almost 25% of their army.
14 Union soldiers and one officer were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor at this battle.
Today, the middle field is both the beginning and the end of the cross-country race. Many runners here have tasted the sweetness of victory and the agony of defeat.
However, this very middle field, which today is an enjoyable place to run or walk, was on September 19th, a killing field.
The Confederates have broken the Union line and were on the verge of victory. Sheraton ordered the 114th New York Regiment into the gap on the middle field that you just saw and told them to hold the line at all cost.
They did, but it was a terrible sacrifice.
The Shenandoah Valley Foundation used the money, the Kevin Shirk and the Millbrook High School Country team and coaches raised, had donated to replace the old, outdated and rural placards, describing various aspects of the battle.
Many placards were hard to read in some cases completely destroyed. These new placards are clean, vibrant, historically accurate, and informative.
They provide great insight to what occurred here on September 19th, 1864.
Today, many residents walk in this battlefield and their coaches and appreciate the place that's there.
The placard on the middle fields today is a key part of the cross-country team on September 19th with a killing field.
When the words on that placard read, and some of the fallen are still here, bodies that were never found are post-body burials that could not be relocated when the dead were later reinterred.
This is hollow ground.
The placard by the blood of Americans, both north and south, have fought and died on September 19th, 1864.
This park is a memorial to them. As you walk the ground, remember their sacrifice.
Thank you, Kevin Shirk, and the other coaches and staff in Millbrook High School, in the Millbrook High School cross-country team, for the contribution to both your cross-country course and to the battlefield.
We appreciate your efforts and gifts to this endeavor.
If you, too, think this is a worthy cause, you can reach out to them to make a donation.
Mr. Shirk, please stand. Are you here?
Please stand. Thank you very much for your effort. You have done a great job.
Thank you.
Thank you, John.
You know, normally I want to shake your hand and congratulations, but I'd like to present you this result.
Well done, you're your young folks that I'm abstaining with your guns.
Thank you.
That's fine. We appreciate your efforts. Thanks for being with us.
All right, we have a guest this evening, and president, and CEO of Wrap Hand and Collectorate Company, Mr. John Huey.
Thank you, sir. Welcome. Appreciate your sharing with us.
Fantastic. Thank you so much, Chairman Dehaven, and administrator of Tierney and board supervisors.
I really appreciate the opportunity to be here this evening. I know you all've got a very full agenda,
and I'll do my very best to be succinct, but I just wanted to, first of all, introduce myself.
I'm the new CEO at Wrap Hand and Collectorate Cooperative. I've been in the role since about August,
I've been at the cooperative for over three years, and then the co-op space for many years of CEO of prior co-ops in a couple of other states.
And I just wanted to spend a few minutes just updating you on a few of the things that the co-op is working on,
and then answer any questions that any of you all might have this evening.
So again, let me also just say, command each of you for your service, and your work to ensure all the stakeholders in Frederick County,
both in the safety and all the issues that you are having to tackle during these times.
So I commend you on that very, very difficult work and the accomplishments.
So just quickly, I'll just kind of give a bit of a high level overview here, and then talk a little bit about your cooperative.
And I know some of you may be members, some of you may be members of Shenandoah Valley, a neighboring cooperative,
but collectively America's electric cooperatives cover about 56% of the nation's land mass.
We have a wide service in 88% of all U.S. counties, which is most, a lot of folks don't quite understand how large the co-op network is.
Rappahannic today is serving in portions of 22 Virginia counties.
We have 17,000 miles of power lines. We have 430 extremely talented dedicated employees, and we operate on an annual budget of about $460 million.
70 million a year is being invested back into the grid in terms of capital investment.
We've got a lot of growth. We're adding about 3,000 accounts a year. We've got a lot of growth that we're working to keep up with.
Here in Frederick County, we've got just short of 22,000 meters, and about 2200 miles of power lines that we maintain on the eastern side of the county.
And again, we really appreciate it and enjoy the relationship with Shenandoah Valley, our neighboring co-op as well.
Some of our, we do have 31 employees who reside in the county, and hopefully that number will continue to grow over time.
And we've got some major key accounts that I'm sure all of you are aware of, Southeastern Container, Riviana Foods, Kraft, and then Monoflow as well.
And so we're always working to make sure that we're taking good care of those accounts.
I mentioned Jeff Henson. Some of you may know Jeff. I know he attends the meetings from time to time.
And he's our director of member services and community relations here in what we call our Blue Ridge region, which is where Frederick County is located in our service territory.
Our cooperative is, of course, we love the cooperative business model. We're governed by nine elected board members.
Vice Chairman Mike Lindsay, his region, actually encompasses Frederick County region, but our members act on behalf of the cooperative at large.
If you want to know more about our governance or any of the board members that are serving today at REC, we have a brand new updated website at www.myrcc.coop.
And we have a governance center there with documents and policies and updates and our positions on a lot of key issues that our members and the board of supervisors may be interested in.
Now, just commenting briefly on the current pandemic situation that we're all working to manage as a member own co-op, we've worked very, very closely with our member owners.
We have continued to work with our members. We are not at this time disconnecting service for nonpayment.
We're working with our membership on long term payment plans in many cases, 12 and even out to 24 months in some cases as we work through this really challenging time.
It's a topic that is of course been very, very intense for the co-op. Our team did a really fantastic job in terms of migrating our office team members to remote work.
Our field crews continue to roll predominantly independently as much as possible in taking care of and maintaining the grid.
Our offices do remain closed, but we offer a number of other avenues for our member owners to interact with the co-op.
And our members have been extremely flexible in working with the co-op over the last many months.
I will say that the co-op also accelerated its capital credit distribution this year.
We've got around $13 million back into the community in the June timeframe to just embody the co-op model and also to help our membership with some reduction in their summertime power bills.
Now in terms of reliability and responsiveness, we are experiencing quite a bit of growth across the territory.
So that is in Frederick County, and we want to make sure we're always a good partner with respect to growth and growth planning.
And so please don't hesitate at any time to reach out to REC. We're glad to get our engineering and design and planning teams engaged in any initiatives that the county may be taking on.
One initiative that we have on the immediate horizon is our Milbrook substation, which is in the Route 7, I-D1 area there to handle some of the commercial and other growth that we're recognizing.
That's a project that we are currently in the planning and environmental review for that effort.
While we try very hard to eliminate outages inevitably, problems do arise on the grid.
And our team really takes pride, our yellow trucks, which we take pride in rolling and being highly responsive.
And I hope that that's your experience with the co-op. If you ever have any challenges with respect to service, myself, Jeff, any of our team members, we're glad to jump in and make sure that we're always here to be a highly responsive.
I won't go into great detail because you do have the slides, but we have a lot of community programs.
The photographs I am showing are pre-COVID. I just want to clarify that, but we do have a lot of community programs.
We've had to resort to different ways to engage with the community this past year, but we do have scholarship programs.
We have the Washington Youth Tour programs. We have community grants and community care programs where we are working with our membership with voluntary contributions to help put those back into the communities to help nonprofits and other organizations that are in need.
So, at any time, if you have an initiative that you'd like to see a rapid panic become a part of, please don't hesitate to ask. We're glad to look at our community programs and see if they can align with the needs here in Frederick County.
And just quickly, our territory is quite diverse. Just a real brief tour here, but we have a lot of subdivision developments that we serve in suburban areas of our 22 County Service Territory.
We have quite a few commercial districts. This happens to be down in Spotsylvania County, and we're always working to support that economic development.
We have recently brought in a new economic development director as well to help with key accounts. We're beginning to get a lot of inquiries from data centers and other types of very large potential beneficial clients for our region that could bring jobs and tax base and, of course, energy for us.
So, we're working very closely with a number of these key accounts. We're beginning to see another wave of high density growth as well in many of our regions.
Now, if you've driven through REC Territory, there's quite the diversity. We do serve a lot of beautiful rural Virginia farmland, and we work very closely with those property owners to make sure that we're very mindful of their property and that we leave their rights of ways and their lands in as good a condition when we're finished with our work and maintaining our lines as it was before we got there.
And our service Territory does span. We actually border Shenandoah Valley Electric Co-op up on the Skyline Drive. So, we serve up this far up as big metals lodge. So, an iconic site that many folks are aware of.
And, of course, our region encompasses a lot of small business and commerce. And so, we're, again, just a very diverse co-op, and I wanted to make sure that you kind of knew some of the areas that we serve around the region.
Now, our members are beginning to ask for a lot more of us. There are a lot of changes underway with the regulatory front here in Virginia, but we're really just consumer and member owner demands.
And so, we're seeing we've got about 1,000 members at this point that are interconnected with solar systems, whether it be rooftop or in some cases ground mount on their farms.
And so, we're seeing very closely to make sure that they have advice from the co-op, they're connected, they have the support of the grid, and they're also contributing kilowatt hours back to the grid to help their neighbors in many cases.
The next wave of technology that is really upon us, and I think will be a really big factor for this particular region.
There are four interstate corridors that go through our service territory, and the commutes of many of the rapid-handic member owners are, you know, into Charlottesville, into Richmond, into Northern Virginia and DC and other areas.
And so, the electric vehicle wave as GM and forward and others bring forward a whole fleet, really, of vehicles.
So, this will create this to be a real big cost saver and a good benefit for our membership.
So, this will put some demands on the co-op in terms of having the charging capacity, and we're working right now on some rate design to really incentivize nighttime charging and help our members charge as affordably as possible.
So, quickly here, ODEC, old Dominion Electric Cooperative is our generation in transmission provider. They're headquartered in Richmond, and they provide service to 11 cooperatives in Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware.
And this is one of their clean natural gas power plants that was put in service in 2019. That's about 1000 megawatt facility there. ODEC has about a 3000 megawatt capacity.
And ODEC is also investing in new forms of energy, right? Just down the road in Clark County here is a solar facility where ODEC is purchasing the offtake of that electricity for its wholesale customers, including rapid-handic.
We're all working on the construction of a fiber optic network that will be traversing through 820 miles route miles traversing through the communities that we serve and interconnecting over 100 of our substations and co-op facilities.
And we have advised our members as well that we will be participating in an upcoming FCC auction with respect to the Royal Development Opportunity Fund, and it's an FCC auction for broadband services, which a number of electric co-ops across the nation are involved in.
Just some final initiatives here. We've for any member, member owners of the co-op that are listening. Again, we try to minimize those outages, but if you haven't signed up for our outage text alerts, again, we're trying to keep the outages from occurring.
We roll as quickly as safely as possible to get the lights back on, but when problems do arise, the next best thing would be to get an update and know what the situation is. And so we're doing a lot of that to make sure our members are not in the dark from an informational perspective when they are in the dark from a electricity perspective.
We also have a wide array of energy use information for members and businesses to look at energy efficiency or sizing new technologies that they may want to integrate into their home or business.
And then just this past week, we launched a new website. So with that again, I commend you for your service to all the stakeholders here in Frederick County.
We appreciate so much our partnership with the member owners and with all the jurisdictions that we serve. And I just want to make sure that you could put a face with the name and that you knew that we're available should Frederick County have any needs of rapid panic and please don't hesitate to contact us.
I hope to follow up Mr. Chairman with an email to you with some contact information and some updated information about the co-op that you feel free to share that with the rest of the board supervisors.
Thank you very much, sir, particularly congratulate you and thank you for your willingness to consider broadband expansion as well as your power grid.
It's really important to rural portions of Virginia and particularly Frederick County.
Absolutely. Thank you.
So it's outside your service area, but you're willing to look at that technology and it's much appreciated.
That's where we're recognizing a lot of opportunities these days with respect to technologies and very much engaging in a number of technology fronts.
So you can be sure that we're going to stay on top of these issues.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it. Have a great evening.
You as well.
Thank you, Scott.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for your time, Mr. Chairman.
I'm sorry I was saying Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
So it's, fortunately, it's on to the library.
I know Carl Rush and I'd like to go and nominate him for the position.
And we regional.
That's where we are.

I am number two, the Frederick County public schools executive director of finance
request a school capital project fund and general fund supplemental appropriation
in the amount of 1,976,978 dollars and 24 cents. This amount represents unspent fiscal
year 2020 school operating funds to be used for the purchase of 19 school buses as
you may recall our capital fund appropriation included one school bus for the current fiscal
year. Local funds are required the committee recommends approval and I would so move.
Third dimension is our second second and now discussion. Anyone? Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor Graber. I'm going to hear about making motion exactly what I made for the
previous that we postponed making any further movement on this matter until we have a joint
meeting with the school board and we have a detailed comprehensive budget of their
current budget year and also 2022 when that should arrive before we go to this first
money in this matter.
Third dimension is our second and the second. Is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman. Yes. So there were several years ago discussion on pre-K education and
we were told as a board that there would be no local fund spent and only to come to
find out that there were several hundred thousand dollars in local money or money spent
outside of the grant for that. We were also given budgets that show that there's money
spent on textbooks, tens of thousands of dollars but we aren't given any real input
on what those textbooks are. I have to wonder because I've asked the question. There's
a deep equity book here. Is that concluded? Is that considered a textbook? And if you
look at who the author of it is, it is a renowned Marxist communist in Gary Howard and that
is what was taught to our school students and to our staff because I have a record
now. I paid $475.63 for this information through a FOIA's request. But it was taught
for several years. I have a complete list of staff in which it was taught to. It is
despicable. I also have a copy of the September 15 meeting where the chairman of the finance
committee made some pretty disparaging comments. I would like for this board to see those
comments as we consider this motion for this request of funds. It is directly tied to
this. It is a 10 minute conversation. Please enjoy this and at the end up, we'll have
a couple of additional comments I would like to make.
Question by Mr. Hester and seconded by Mrs. Washington, the committee agreed to forward
to the forebord a recommendation to approve FY21 budget adjustments to the school capitals
project on totaling $1,976,978.24 for the purchase of 19 school buses and with that
Mr. Chairman, I will make that motion for that amount.
All right, we have a motion by Mr. Lake. Do we have a second?
Second.
Second by Mr. Hester. Any discussion?
Mr. Chairman. Just a question for administration really quickly. Is there anything that's
pressing or we need to make a decision tonight or we may lose these funds back to the county?
Mr. Chairman, I would like the board to consider maybe postponing this until our next
meeting just receive the information today and although school buses are definitely
a worthy endeavor and are needed, I think there may also be other projects which we
can consider as well and would allow this board time to think about that and kind of
weigh those options before decision.
I think so we had some of this discussion so let me just get into it.
Let me start by saying I think our three first year board members are being penalized
this year. It takes me back to 2012 my first year on the board and what happens is that
there are numerous many trips made to Charlottesville and Richmond in a training mode where you
learn about all the school board and the school board stuff. I would care to venture by this
time in my first year in 2012 I probably made six or seven trips to either Charlottesville
or Richmond and so what all that comes down to Mr. Monk is that we are a consumer of information
from the school system and we are a policy board and what we need to keep an eye on is policy
being followed and it's the school system following good decent business practices.
We do not, I can tell you this is my ninth year, we do not do the weed stuff.
Would you stop that for a minute?
I'd really like to know what the weed stuff is because this is your chairman folks
of the finance committee for the school board. Please continue.
And we are consumers of information from the staff. We judge does it meet the policy
requirement is a good business practice but the bottom line is we don't adjust figures.
We don't basically and to tell all three of you we do not run the school division.
Would you stop that? Would you reverse that for ten seconds? Make sure I heard that properly.
We don't adjust figures. We don't basically and to tell all three of you we do not run the school division.
Would you pause that? I'm very concerned my friends. If the school board does not run the school division,
who are we giving 86 million dollars of our money to every year? Please continue.
This is Dr. Sylvain and his staff business and we keep to our policies.
So in that regard, if we were to delay this, come back and think of other categories.
It's theirs to decide Dr. Sylvain's size on this night buying these 19 buses.
We're probably not going to change that. We don't know enough about all the categories of the budget book.
That's probably this thick. That would you pause there and you may not have seen for me.
We don't know enough about all the categories of the budget book.
That's probably this thick that where money you may or may not be spent.
Would you pause that please?
So I believe there's an acknowledgement there that there's a budget book about this thick.
I'd like to see that budget book. I've asked for it.
There have been a couple of school board members that have asked for that budget book as well.
We haven't seen it. The budget book that I've gotten is about that thick and it's online.
And it talks about textbooks, but I have to wonder if it includes this textbook that is a part of a Communist Manufesto.
If they don't run the school division and they're acknowledging that there's a document
that is thick that I have FOIAs twice once was a $7,800 figure for any documents surrounding the budget,
which was not also the FOIAs request was not followed appropriately.
I have to question what else is hidden that we're not seeing. Please continue.
Sit around. Think of it as a few, but it's really not our job.
And so that's where I would put it.
And again, I want to go back to the three first year members.
I think you've been penalized. I think you've been put behind without these trips, without this training.
And I feel bad for you for that. But in that regard, I just think we have to take the information.
We have to trust what we're hearing and what we're getting.
And if it's good business practice, that's where we go.
Anybody?
Thank you, Mr. Lake.
So, Mr. Chairman, I think those comments have to be followed up.
I think it is this board's prerogative to make decisions about the school division and its future and its finances.
And obviously, I think we have some great administrative support.
And their work does not go unnoticed, but as a board, it definitely is within our prerogative to make those type of decisions.
Especially when it's impacting, we're talking about $2 million.
We're not talking about $20,000.
So I think at that level, at least giving it consideration, as opposed to seeing it just four hours ago, is prudent and allows us to give full consideration to all the options that are out there, not saying that buses aren't important.
Maybe that we do go with those 19 buses, but at least giving us the time to consider that would be helpful.
Are you making a motion, Mr. Monk?
There's an motion on the floor that's been seconded, so I have a motion on the floor.
Would you please pause the video?
We are in discussion.
You have the prerogative.
I'm a little bit confused here.
I'm not quite sure why the vice chairman is running the meeting with the chairman present.
And I'm a little bit concerned that the chairman is not correcting other people on this board.
And there seems to be some improper procedure, but let's let's let this play out, please continue.
Mr. Chairman, I would move that we lay this on the table.
Okay, we have a motion, we have a second.
The drivers help me, there could be an amendment that they're tabling that we have to take the original motion off the table.
They have to take action either Mr. Blake and Mr. Custard, we have to agree to get brought to their motion to adopt a budget adjustment pose for Mr. Multipid to make a motion to amend motion brought forward by Mr. Blake and Mr. Custard and the board would dispose of that and then take action on whatever does.
In just a minute, you will get to see how they proceed and I think that that is important to the closure of this.
Okay, so to my point, Mr. Monkey, is that a motion?
Yeah, actually, as I said, moved a lay on the table, so I would need a second.
Okay, Mr. Monkey, okay, do we have a second for Mr. Monkey's amendment?
All right, hearing none, that does not table. We're back to our original motion. Any further discussion?
May I ask a question?
Mr. Chairman, in previous discussions, when we were discussing the hybrid model and potential budget cuts from the county and things like that, there were discussions of potentially having to furlough staff and things like that if it were unsustainable.
Is there still, is that still a potential thing that we may be facing?
I guess my question being, could this money be earmarked for that? If that were something we were facing, does that make sense?
I'll, we address, I think we tried to address, sort of address that.
I asked Dr. Savine if there was need to put reserve funds aside for future COVID impact.
And I mean, this is not coming, you know, we've seen this in the daily briefs that are coming from around the states where that's being considered.
But I won't speak for Dr. Savine, but he, you know, he answered that there are pockets and there are sources of cares and COVID money that they are certain that are coming.
And so he feels confident.
Absolutely. Just making sure there's nothing else that we could be facing, I guess is my question there.
Mr. Chairman, would you like to address that?
Yes, sir, I would be glad to speak to that and what was as Mr. Lake mentioned was part of the discussion in the Finance Committee.
We have been very aggressive in applying for the many buckets that exist in terms of the CARES Act funds.
We just received funding from the county request of 3.5 when we certainly appreciate the sport of county administrator and the board of supervisors.
And their initial installment of right around, believe us, $8 million, we were, we were fortunate to benefit from 3.5 million.
They have recently received an additional 8 million second installment.
I have communicated with the county administrator R&10 and also our needs that will continue to grow as we recognize and in the Finance Committee.
We looked at the list in terms of PPE, also Waffa hotspots, nearly a half a million dollars.
But the PPE with the demand, we anticipate those needs will grow, but we are fortunate to have significant choices regarding a variety of buckets of funding through the CARES Act that will allow us to support that.
And then while we do have a plan, and we recognize that phase one, we, from the start of the school year, reduced our budget from about 10%.
Would you go back 10 seconds or so and make sure I heard that properly?
We do have a plan, and we recognize that phase one, we, from the start of the school year, reduced our budget from about 10%.
But certainly that the CARES Act funds are helping us to address these needs.
Thank you, Mr. Volumotion, I would like to share a couple things there that I saw.
The 3.5 million that he speaks of regarding the CARES Act, that was what the school system stated would be required to do online learning and to take care of the needs for distance learning.
The 3.5 million dollars from the CARES Act was should cover that.
That's what the estimate that the school system gave us as needed needed cost, so that did not come out of their budget.
Additionally, they should be receiving an additional 3 million dollars in CARES money to take care of any new or additional things that arise.
Therefore, that should also not be coming out of their budget.
I'm a little bit confused on where that 10% reduction came from, because this board did not reduce their budget by 10%.
We gave them the full amount of funding that they received last year, and in fact, if you go back over the last five years, there's been between a 27 and a half and a 30% increase in funding for schools over the past five years.
Therefore, I'm a little bit remiss to try to understand where the 10% reduction came from as I spoke with my school board representative yesterday, and he did not vote on a 10% reduction in these school spending.
Therefore, I have a little bit of question where the authority came from to reduce those funds.
I would like to now ask my school board representative and anybody else who has asked for a comprehensive budget that does not receive one from the County Administrator to possibly follow up with the State Attorney General and ask for a state police investigation as to why the information is not being disseminated to our school board.
They have a fiscal responsibility under Virginia code to disperse the funds that are given to them.
I am extremely concerned that they are not being provided the opportunity to see the numbers, to see the books, to make good decisions.
As we just saw in this video, it would appear, according to the finance chairman, that we do not enter into the weeds, that we do not adjust figures, his words not mine, that we do not run the school division.
That scares me to death.
Now, we do not know enough about all categories.
What categories we are talking about. I do not get to see them.
I have a lot of concerns, or what we just saw in this last 10 minute video.
If we continue and give these funds to the school board right now, we as a board of supervisors are dialect of our duty.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Further discussion on the amended motion, anyone?
Mended motion to delay. Supervisor Fisher?
I think Supervisor McCarthy was right.
Didn't hear you there. Supervisor McCarthy?
Yes.
Further discussion on the amended motion, please sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At our meeting on September 23rd, I pointed out to our board that the Virginia code mandates that each school board shall manage and control the funds available to the school board for public schools.
Shall manage and control that means that not only is it the school board's job, but it's a legal duty of the school board to manage and control the funds under their care and to do otherwise would be misfeasants in office at best and possibly mouthies.
We have very clear indication at this point that the pretty kind of school board members have not been engaged in the management of the school or control of the school funds.
We have evidence in fact that certain board members were working under the false premise that it is not their job to make financial decisions or on the school board.
Despite my admonition on September 23rd, there's still no indication that the federal county school board has taken any steps necessary to familiarize themselves with the school's expenditures and budget.
As I stated on September 23rd, knowing these facts about the failure of the school board to carry out their statutory duty, I cannot in good conscience vote to expend county taxpayer dollars knowing that there's a lack of proper oversight.
I don't see how any supervisor can good faith approve the appropriation of additional funds until such time as we're assured that the school board has taken unnecessary steps to properly oversee the expenditure of the taxpayer funds.
You'll recall the recent debacle of Warren County where millions of dollars were appropriated industrial development authority, even after there was evidence that there was no proper oversight of the funds being expended.
In that case, the board of supervisors was indicted for criminal charges related to the failure to require proper oversight.
I'm not saying that the school administration has done anything inappropriate or criminal.
What I'm saying is that the body responsible for ensuring that nothing inappropriate has occurred has made it clear that for many years they have failed to take an active role in managing and controlling the taxpayer's funds.
I am aware of one school board member who has stated that he has requested from the school administration the budget information necessary to do his job to do his duty.
There are also at least three members of this board, the board supervisors that have asked for the same information.
And time and time again, the school administration has refused to provide the information and instead refers us to a fairly useless and very immediate budget document on the school's website.
Why is it that we're not allowed to see where the taxpayer's money is being spent? What are they hiding?
And if they've got nothing to hide, why don't they disperse that information to us that we can see that they've got nothing to hide?
Therefore, I encourage all my fellow supervisors to do the right thing, to do our jobs, to safeguard the taxpayer's funds, to ensure that tax money is being spent on the priorities most necessary for the common good of our community.
I encourage my fellow supervisors to require that the school board take proper control and management of its school's funds before any additional funds are appropriated to the school system.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir. Further discussion on the amendment in motion. Anyone? Anyone?
Hearing no one, the supervisor Fisher, do you state the amendment motion again?
To delay consideration of this and on three separate steps that I can't adequately repeat.
I will repeat them for you, Mr. Chairman, if you'd like.
The first condition is if there be a joint school board board of supervisors meeting where this can be discussed.
The second is that there is a detailed comprehensive budget provided to any board member or school board member who desires to see such.
The last is to see how the care's money is dispersed and the reason for that being part of the care's money could be utilized possibly for school bus purchases, depending upon the buckets in which invalid is laid out.
I answer your question, Mr. Provost Fisher.
How is your vote?

I'm sorry?

I am extremely disappointed in my fellow board members for not assuring that these citizens tax dollars are being accounted for.
It is extremely concerning to me to think that we are not going to require the school board to show us that they are being good stewards of the hard earned tax dollar money.
That our taxpayers are paying every year.
Thank you very much.

Item number three, the Frederick County Public Schools Executive Director of Finance request a school operating funds supplemental appropriation in the amount of $2,435,300.
This amount represents care, CRF funds for local education agencies.
No local funds required.
And the committee originally discussed advertising the item for public hearing.
However, the amount of the request is under the threshold that requires a public hearing.
As a result, the action requested is the supplemental appropriation and I would so move.

Mr. Chairman, Supervisor Dun?
For the same reasons I stated before, we need to have a meeting.

Thank you Mr. Chairman.

Any?
So we have an amendment motion to delay consideration until he understands the sheriff's overtime.
Are we clear?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes sir.
I didn't understand that to be the case.
It's not a matter of understanding his overtime.
It's a matter of, if I heard him right, please correct me if I'm wrong of getting a response and having some information as to where finances stand regarding the overtime.
I think he understands the overtime was utilized.
He just would like a breakdown of where some of those expenditures were.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.
That's correct.

CPPA approval.
Any one?
Approval or denial?
Anyone?
Seeing no one, we'll close the public hearing portion.
This is Stonewall.
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to make a motion to approve the 2035
comprehensive plan amendment.
CPPA 01-20 waverly farm, sewer and water service,
inclusion request.
The motion is our second.
The second.
Is there any discussion?
Anyone?
Hearing none.
Supervisor Fisher.
Hi.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Hi.
Supervisor Wells.
Hi.
Supervisor Dunn.
Hi.
Supervisor Graver.
Hi.
Chair votes aye and the motion carries.
Request is approved.
Ms. Perkins, 2035 comprehensive plan amendment
northeast land use plan as it pertains to Swaza.
And thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This is kind of part two of this of this study.
This proposal is for adjustments to the boundary
of the sewer water service area for the entire limits
of the boundary for the northeast land use plan.
Now, this review really focused on, like I said,
that overall boundary, it looked at uses that currently have
a plan of future land use but have not previously been
included in the boundary as well as some areas that may
not have followed property lines.
Now, we did coordinate this study with Frederick Water
and they did adopt their recommendations for the Route 11
corridor.
And this effort was really to make sure that these areas
with plan land uses could be served by Frederick Water
in the future.
So, really, the Frederick Water recommendations,
it showed areas with plan land uses that did not,
that would not need public water and sewer to be taken out.
Areas that would need public water and sewer to be placed
inside the limits.
So, what that really showed is removal of about 681 acres
in addition of about 1,017 acres into the Swaza.
So, it's a net increase in the sewer water service area
of about 335 acres.
Now, those areas that are shown for inclusion,
just for reference, you have Interstate 81.
Here's the West Virginia boundary.
You have this area north along West Church Road.
You have this area on the opposite side along the boundary,
on the Woodside area.
You have this area here, which is the area we just previously
discussed for wavily.
And then this area with the, in the gray, is the area for
removal.
So, this really followed the same timeline as the past.
So, most recently it did go before the planning commission
for public hearing.
Sorry, I need to back up a little bit.
So, when this went before the board at your October 14th meeting,
I would note that the board did send for those two additional
areas that were not previously included,
which is the area near wavily and this area between those two
other expansion areas.
And I would note that because of the timelines and the
advertising that this had to follow a separate track,
so that is going to the planning commission for public hearing
at their November 4th meeting and it will follow then with the board.
So, the planning commission, they did hold a public hearing for this
at their October 21st meeting and they did recommend approval.
So, we are seeking a decision from the board on these adjustments
to the Zero Water Service area for the removal of that 681 acres
and the addition of that 1,017 acres for the increase in the
Suwaza for 335 acres.
And I'd be glad to answer any questions.
Thank you.
Questions, is anyone from Ms. Perkins?
Supervisor Doug.
Ms. Perkins, for the record, the area that's being reduced
is currently a quarry and so it's really not susceptible to Suwaza.
It'd be very difficult to put that in there.
So, the reduction is not a give up as much as the fact that there's nothing there is correct.
Correct.
Okay.
The Suwaza, in that area, it's mining.
It does not specifically need sewer water.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Any other questions from Ms. Perkins?
Anyone?
Thank you, ma'am.
Appreciate it.
So, is the public hearing, would anyone like to comment concerning this proposed
change to the Suwaza line?
Anyone at all?
Seeing no one will close the public hearing portion of the meeting?
It's again, Stonewall.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a motion to approve the 2035 comprehensive plan
amendment.
Northeastern land use plan.

Thank you.

Chair votes aye.
The motion carries.
Board Liaison reports, are there any?
Hearing none?
Citizen comments?
Is there anyone that signed up?
Is there anyone who would like to say anything or share anything with the Board of Supervisors?
Mr. Chair, members of the Board.
Mr. Tierney, I'm David Savan, Superintendent of Frederick County Public Schools, and resident
of the Shawnee District.
I want to thank each of you for your sacrifice, for your hard work in serving this great county.
So I thank you because there is much sacrifice in many very challenging decisions.
So I thank you.
A few weeks ago, you should have received in writing an invitation to our school boards annual
school board training session, which focuses primarily on the budget and CIP.
I want to publicly invite you to attend this meeting, which will occur on Friday, November the 13th,
at Lord Fairfax Community College.
I know many of you have attended previously, and certainly we welcome your participation,
if your schedule allows, but we welcome your attendance at this school board meeting.
The primary purpose of the meeting is for the superintendent and staff to establish
some potential budget drivers, allow the school board to establish priorities, which is ultimately approved
in a following school board meeting that provides the budget priorities for the superintendent staff
for the annual proposed budget, which is approved by the school board.
Certainly, we have much to be proud of.
In Frederick County, we have Frederick County Public Schools is an award-winning school division
recognized in many ways for its leadership at the state level, and has also recognized in many ways
at the national level.
We have much to be proud of, and for years, we have engaged in a very civil respectful way.
We have not always agreed on every issue, but we are committed to doing what's right and working together.
I certainly welcome that.
I know we've had some conversation tonight regarding finances.
Our school board receives a financial report on a monthly basis of all revenues, expenditures, construction,
and as a courtesy and basically an agreement with the Board of Supervisors since 2010,
on a quarterly basis through the finance committee, this board receives the same information,
all revenues, expenditures, construction projects, over $25,000.
I'll just mention through the finance committee, you just received a year-end review document,
also, at the beginning of this year, you received our full comprehensive budget document.
That is, for the eighth consecutive year, received a meritorious award, much like, very similar to the comprehensive document
that Mrs. Schiffler puts out for you, and once again, I believe, both systems, the county government, as well as the school system.
We have much to be proud of, and both of these budget documents are comprehensive and are recognized by professional external sources.
I will provide both documents as a courtesy, while I'll recognize each of you have this, I'll leave this, with the clerk for additional review for those that may be interested.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Dr. Schiffler.
Is there anyone else who would like to address the board?
Welcome, sir.
Yes, Alan Morrison, Gainesburg District.
I'm a little unsettled to find out that more than half of the taxpayers' investment in the Frederick County is being spent without elected representative approval.
Civics 101, the people elect the officers, your elected officers, you have judicial responsibilities, school board, or elected officials, they have judicial responsibility to the people of their district.
That needs close attention.
That's why we have an elective form of government, contrary to what you hear on the TV.
We don't have a democracy. We have a republic.
Summary budget information can be more of a smokescreen than actual information.
And when you only deal in summaries, executive-level summaries, or summaries of this, or summaries of that, you are making decisions based on wrong or typically unclear information.
I think it's a parable that we have people run for office, get elected to office, and then this do not discharge the duties of that office.
In some cases, they're told not to.
In some cases, they don't want to cause problems.
In some cases, they don't think it's a big deal.
But when you take money out of my pocket and give it to somebody, and they spend it, and nobody knows where it goes, that is a problem.
Now, we generally have some kind of idea where it goes. It goes to the schools, and schools are wonderful, and schools are necessary.
But every business I've ever worked in, there were cost-cutting opportunities.
We don't do that in Frederick County. Our budgets only go one way. They go up.
They never level out. They never go down.
And I think we are not doing all of our jobs when we allow this to happen. Thank you.
And so on who you're speaking to, Mr. Morrison, you're speaking to your elected school board. They decide how they spend.
Oh, they don't. They do. That's their job. That's their job. It's not a debate. I have an opportunity to make a comment, and it's with respect.
This board decides how much money they get. No one else can tell us how much money that they get. That's our job.
That's our elected board whom you vote for. Decide how they spend it. That's the way it is.
How can they make a decision when they have little or no information?
You would have to speak to your elected school board member.
I have. I'm sorry if he was non-responsive or her.
Point of order, sir. Yes, sir.
I have been called out several times for having questions or dialogue with a person from the diocese.
If that is indeed against the rules, I would ask that we follow the rules, allow Mr. Morris to speak, and you have a chance to speak after this.
Mr. Morris made a comment, and I believe that he has made his comment well.
And I don't believe that it is in the place of this board to to rag on or to pull him to distract him from his comment. Thank you.
It wasn't my intent, and I will conclude rapidly. Yes, sir.
I thought you had. Third of my time was used up.
Procedure is a wonderful thing. It can be a great place to hide. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir.
Always great to get an answer. Tim Reagan, back creek district. Yes, sir.
I came here today to speak about something totally different than what I just saw on that with the school board.
We all know that you're like they said, you're appointed, you get elected, and you're there to do a job.
I'm watching, and I looked at this, and I said 1.976978.24 being used to buy school buses.
When there are kids that are special needs that can't go into schools today, because the schools don't have the capabilities of getting them in.
If you've ever dealt with a child with special needs, you will find wearing a mask puts a kid into a meltdown.
Now, there was two reasons. I asked Mr. Forman today, I watched the school board meeting halfway through it. It shut off. It's no longer available.
I asked him where do you get this from. He said, well, come to us, and we will give it to you.
Now, I'm listening to what's going on. It's the court would cost $400 to get that. If I'm correct, and if that's the cost to getting that.
But yet you stand here, and you appropriate $1.9 million to get school buses when they have a $6 million facility that I believe could fix those 19 school buses for at least one year and use this money to help these kids that need to help.
To get back into school. I said, your job is to make sure the money is spent correctly.
You give it to the school board. Obviously, the school board can't spend it correctly, because they don't know what to do with it.
So they leave it down to two people. A guy that doesn't know how to get kids that are in special needs back in schools.
Do you think there's something wrong with this picture? I do.
I don't mean to stand here and reprimand you throughout this whole pandemic. It's been a big issue for everybody. It's caused millions of dollars for tons of businesses.
But they give 19 school buses with a $6 million school facility to fix school buses. They can't keep school buses running for one or two years.
There's something wrong with this picture. It really is. I always noticed that there are the same four people constantly voting the same way.
I just may take Mr. I'm going to pronounce it wrong. Go business and write a letter to the attorney general to find out why you're just throwing away money.
That's all I have to say. Be well. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Anyone else?
Miss Don, welcome.
Joy, done from Redbud District. I just want to ask, if your child came to you and asked you for $20 or $50, do you just hand it over? Well, of course not.
You would ask them, first of all, why do you want it? What are you going to spend it for? That is how a parent is being responsible.
So, as a former teacher of over 20 years, I want to tell you, every year I was always given a budget at the beginning of the year.
I had to be accountable for every single penny that I spent. I did this in several states where I've taught. I also did it when I taught at Ailer Middle School quite a few years ago.
So, in the beginning of the year, I was told exactly how much money I had and I had to be able to document and say exactly where I was spending my money.
So, my question is, as a taxpayer, I want to know where my money is going. I am really disappointed in some of you as board members that we do not know where our tax money is being spent.
Thank you. Anyone else? Mr. Newcombs, sir, welcome.
I find the video and the associated information, which I've had knowledge of now for a couple of weeks, very disturbing.
Now, obviously, the chairman of the Finance Committee for the School Board is from Gainesboro. So, the citizens and taxpayers of Gainesboro are going to have to decide what they want to do about that.
And hopefully, we'll decide wisely. But I find it disturbing that having chastised a junior member of the school board based upon his years of experience that Mr. Lake then turned around and said despite all those years of experience, he had no idea what that thick budget consisted of.
And he's the chairman of the Finance Committee. Now, they are duly elected independently of the board of supervisors, but you are the conduit of the taxpayers' money.
And as such, you have a fiduciary responsibility that faced with that kind of evidence, you need to take action. And if you don't take action, then I suspect there will be consequences for that also.
It's clear that the management of the funds are the responsibility of the school board, but clearly, when you have your joint meetings, what you approve is based upon your understanding of what they're going to use as funds for.
There's nothing in what we heard this evening that tells us what those funds that they're carrying forward were originally intended for.
I can tell you from discussions that I've had with chairman of various committees in the school board that some of those people have no clue what they're doing functionally.
And there are things such as school maintenance that go wanting, yet every year you approve funding for school maintenance that then disappears into those general categories that they use, which are absolutely worthless from a management perspective.
So unless you know line by line, what that money is allocated for and how it's being spent, you have no assurance that the school board is doing with those funds, what you believe they're doing with them.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Anyone else?
Anyone?
I think no one will close the public comment portion, board comments, anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
I'd like to respond to a couple things.
There was a comment made this evening by an individual from the school district.
The stated that we received the outline every month of expenditures and income.
I would concur that we do receive that.
However, it has simply stated it states textbooks where it states IT material or other things.
There are no line items broken down where we can truly know where those funds are being spent.
So to state that we know where everybody, where every dollar is going is a clear misrepresentation of what we are receiving.
I would like to clarify that.
Also, I've heard some discussion from some folks that the comments we heard this evening by the chairman of the finance committee of the school board was simply a misspeaking.
I would like to make it very clear.
It is not a misspeaking.
I have heard similar comments three times over the past year and there are more recordings where that one came from.
On that note, I would like for all of us on this board to strongly consider how we are spending our money.
If we do not know where our money is going, I would strongly recommend that we do not spend it.
Thank you very much.
Anyone else?
Any other comments?
Mr. Chairman, in the last year or two, we have had decisions on events centers by farmers, by landowners, etc.
A supervisor, McCarthy and I would like to have a meeting on November 9th at 7 p.m. in this room with farmers and landowners who do not have events centers.
We are trying to go through and go into some more depth on whether that is necessary to keep areas rural and agriculture or other options.
We will reach out to farmers but for those who are listening here, November 9th, 7 p.m. in this room if you have an interest in how to preserve the rural parts of Frederick County.
Number two, a few years ago, Mr. Fisher.
A few years ago, Mr. Fisher, you left this committee and then come back.
I have enjoyed working with you and although this may be your last meeting, I just have two comments.
Number one, if we have a joint school board supervisor meeting because I made that request back in March, I, as one, would encourage you to attend.
I would be glad to say, hey, please attend because I think you have made some good contributions to this board.
We have agreed sometimes and disagreed. I think you have made good contributions on our joint meetings previously.
So if we have that joint meeting, I hope you can attend if you so desire.
But then Mr. Fisher, I will just say, I have enjoyed working with you. It has been a pleasure and thank you.
Anyone else?
Thank you, Mr. Fisher.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I had planned to bring to you tonight one more spiel for the airport because we've got some good things going on.
But unfortunately, due to some tough events there today, I'd like to postpone that and maybe in December, you allow me and Mr. Sabo to come back and show you some of the good things that are going on at the airport.
We've reduced the use of local funds and our economic development efforts there.
But since this is my last, hopefully my last meeting right now, I just want to say I thank you to staff, especially the legal public works, planning and administrative.
We've got great staff here in the county and I appreciate all your support and help.
Mr. Dun, I appreciate your comments because I think one of the things this country could really do is you and I don't always agree.
But you know, we're still friends and we talk rationally and everything and that's just much appreciated and I thank you for your comments.
Welcome.
And the last thing is I just wish this board well as this county continues to grow and all the challenges you will face.
I wish you sincerely well.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Brother Jean, thank you.
We've worked together for many years and it's always a pleasure.
You always work hard. You're always prepared. You always have good comments.
And also we miss Betsy, a big big time because she reminded me of that when I asked you if you'd be willing to do this.
So for her, I think my comment to her was I would be there on a bended knee.
Anyway, thank you again, your community is grateful. We've all appreciated it.
Hope we'll continue to see you regularly.
Anyone else have comments?
I just like to thank supervisor Fisher. It has certainly been a pleasure and I wish you very well.
Mr. Chairman, what else?
Mr. Chairman, thank you, Mr. Fisher, for all your service to the county.
That was a great friend.
And I move we adjourn.
We're in the motion second.
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed? No.
We thank everyone for their time and attention.
Thank you.
