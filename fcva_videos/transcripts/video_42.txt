1.2% is what we see in the flu season as far as a case fatality rate.
So we're not really sure how many mild cases there are.
We don't have enough test kits right now to test everybody.
I will tell you that South Korea has been testing just about everybody.
They could lay their hands on who they thought might have been infected.
And they've measured a case fatality rate of under one percent.
It's about 0.8% right now in South Korea.

try to avoid touching your eyes and nose and mouth
unless you've just washed your hands.
How many people here have ever worn contacts?
You know you wash your hands really well
before you put your contacts in
because you've got to stick your fingers in your eyes.
Same thing right now,
that you don't want the germs in your eyes and nose or mouth.
If you're a person who tends to touch their face
whether thinking or sitting there,
try not to do it, try to be aware.
Stay away from people who are sick.
I mean, this is kind of a duff thing,
but if you see someone who's obviously not well,
give them six feet of distance at least,
maybe invite them to go home if they work for you.
Consider, and especially if you're in one of those high risk groups,
consider where you're going,
whether you're going into a place with a crowd,
maybe not the time to see a first run movie with a crowd at theater,
maybe not the time to ride the metro.
If you're in a high risk group,
of course, you know, that's true all through flu season two.
If you're sick, stay home.
Stay home from work.
Stay home from church.
Stay home from the store.
Stay home from your community meetings.
Stay home home.
Get someone else to do your shopping for you.
If you're in a high risk group, again,
you want to stockpile a little bit of food,
or if you think maybe you're likely to be exposed,
that way you don't have to go out quite so often,
but don't hoard stuff.
Cover coughs and sneezes.
Don't be like that guy in the picture.
Okay.
Tissue.
Cover completely.
Press against your face.
Throw it away.
Wash your hands.
Don't have a tissue.
Crook your elbow.
Press hard against your face.
It needs to stop the airflow from spraying out.
The old classic cough into the fist like this does absolutely no good.
It sprays out in the air.
It sprays all over the hand that you're going to try and shake hands with.
Pleaning disinfect commonly use surfaces.
These would probably be a good one to do after the meeting's over before tomorrow.
What else?
They'll be aware and take this seriously.
The World Health Organization just declared this a pandemic.
What does that mean?
That means it's all over the world.
It doesn't mean it's going to depopulate the world.
It doesn't mean people are going to be dying in the streets.
It just means it's all over the world.
So the word pandemic, although it does include panic in there,
we should not panic.
We should take this seriously but take it logically.
This is not Ebola.
Ebola kills about 70% of the people that get it.
It's not smallpox.
It's not black plague.
It's not the 1918 flu.
Not unless it changes its character a whole lot very soon.
Okay.
It is not one of those diseases but it is a serious illness.
And for the elderly, for the infirm, for people with immune disorders,
it can be deadly.
But so can the flu.
When do you seek medical care?
Well, if you have been traveling to a high risk area and right now,
places like Seattle and New Rochelle, New York or high risk areas,
if you travel to any of those high risk areas and you have fever cough
or difficulty breathing, it's time to get seen.
If you have any of the above symptoms and you have close contact
with somebody who you know has the actual disease, time to get seen.
If you have severe symptoms in that same constellation,
the cough, the fever, the difficulty breathing,
regardless of whether you've had any contact, time to get seen.
And again, if you're in a high risk group, go sooner rather than later.
If you're going to see healthcare and you think you might have COVID-19,
please call first.
Let them know.
Or if you're pulling up to the ER, have someone walk in and say,
you got a possible coronavirus patient.
They'll come out, they'll put a mask over your face,
and they'll escort you to a room where you're not going to share your disease
with the other people in the waiting room.
Speaking of surgical masks, they stop outgoing germs very nicely.
They do nothing to stop incoming germs.
They're designed to keep the surgeon's sneeze out of the sterile wound
on the operating table.
That's why they're there.
Only the tightly fitted custom fit ones will actually slow down incoming germs.
And those don't work unless they've been properly fitted.
So there are a lot of scammers on the internet selling those things.
Please don't hoard stuff.
People are buying toilet paper.
I'm absolutely the funnel just to why people are buying toilet paper.
This is not a gastrointestinal disease.
It's not that we know about.
Besides being inherently selfish activity, hoarding is also wasteful.
Things go bad if you don't use them.
So do keep enough in your house so that if you can't go out for a couple of days,
you're going to be able to manage.
But don't hoard stuff, please.
Get two hand sanitizers, not 20.
Leave the other 18 for somebody else.
So stay informed.
There's a lot of good information out there.
There's a lot of lousy information out there.
Anything that comes out of the CDC from the CDC.gov site,
you can pretty much take that to the bank.
The nice thing about that site is as long as you stay away from the
health care providers kind of medical geeky section,
it's all in plain English.
And in layman's English and it's intuitively organized too,
it's really very well done.
You don't have to memorize that address.
You just type CDC and coronavirus.
It'll come up.
Other sites, my own organization site for Virginia Department of Health.
Again, VDH and coronavirus.
We have a good page too with a lot of links to the CDC page.
If you're interested in events outside the United States,
WHO.int, World Health Organization is a good one.
Beware of anything any and dot com or dot org or dot net or dot
anything else.
It might be all right.
It might be not.
Don't stay glued to the TV.
Some of the talking heads are experts and some of them are not.
Some of them might be experts on China,
but they're not experts on medicine.
So just be careful.
Check this CDC page once a day.
That's probably enough, honestly.
And look out for the scammers.
I did want to just try to put this in a little bit of perspective too
as far as numbers.
Worldwide right now, there are roughly identified 120,000 cases
of this novel coronavirus.
About 4,200 I think people have died from it since then.
That's worldwide.
In the United States, we've turned up about 1,200 cases now,
and we have I think 36 deaths.
And about half of those were in one nursing home in the Pacific Northwest.
Last this past year, we had between 10 and 20 million cases of flu
in the United States.
Probably 18,000 people died from the flu.
So 18,000 versus 36.
18,000 deaths in the United States versus 40,200 deaths in the entire world.
Now, coronavirus isn't done.
Its cases are still on the rise in a number of places.
In Italy, it's still on the rise.
Here in the United States, it's still on the rise.
It's common to the Shenandoah Valley.
We're not done with it.
So we'll see what it's like when it's over.
But be aware.
Take it seriously.
Don't panic.
And just remember, flu season's coming back next year.
So please, every one of you get a flu shot next year.
If you don't want to get something like the coronavirus,
we'll flu acts a whole lot like it.
So I'm not sure when we're going to have an immunization for the coronavirus.
It'll be months.
It might be a year.
We already have one for the flu.
So come October, please do get your flu shot.
What are your questions?
Questions, anyone?
No, no, no.
We don't know the full extent of who gets it.
But again, the people who get the worst disease, older folks,
people over 60, people with chronic diseases, people with bad immune system.
They do.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
The question was, what about the military is it affecting the military?
I'm not aware of that right now.
Dr. Green, we understand that you said you'd be willing to hang around.
Yeah, I can step outside if you want to provide with a meeting.
And we can go on with our meeting.
Can't tell you how much we appreciate all you do for us.
And for coming and sharing with us this evening.
And so when we encourage, there were a couple of hands over here.
Courage yourselves to get together with Dr. Green.
And he'll try to answer your questions.
So I'll stand in the hallway.
Thank you very much.
We really appreciate it.
You're welcome.
Your tax dollars at work.
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good reminder.
All right.
That will bring us to when we just moved.
This in common.
Yes, we are.
So this is portion of the meeting for citizens to comment on agenda items that are not subject to public hearing.
I think we had some folks sign up.
And just for future information.
The public works committee report is not a particular subject.
But we're going to invite you to comment.
Make your comment.
You'd signed up.
You came under that impression.
Please share your name.
Magical district.
Limit your comments to three minutes or less.
Please.
Good evening.
My name is Ruth Perrine.
And I live in the Bat Creek district.
I'm here before you this evening concerning the input process of the proposed Shawnee land budget.
On December 3rd of last year, an item on the public works committee agenda read review proposed fiscal year 2021 budgets.
Not only were the budgets reviewed, but a vote was taken by the public works committee to raise the Shawnee land sanitary district tax $140 for the 2021 fiscal year, which was a complete surprise to our community.
At our February 3rd, Shawnee land sanitary district advisory committee meeting, we were presented with a proposed budget that reflected that increase.
We had had a $100 fee increase that began this fiscal year, which residents are struggling to cope with.
So this budget scenario was of concern.
Then from the February 5th county budget work session, the public work staff were asked to come up with a couple other budget scenarios.
The Shawnee land community was presented with four budget scenarios at a special meeting that the Shawnee land advisory committee called.
We were assured at that meeting that we would have an opportunity to voice our views to the public works committee at their March meeting, but that was derailed when the chairman of the public works committee was unable to attend their meeting on February 25th.
And another vote was taken by the public works committee to accept the original budget with no fee increase. Possibly it was a simple miscommunication, but it did leave some residents and property owners who fund this budget feeling insignificant and betrayed.
There was a time when Shawnee land advisory committee officially voted to accept the budget put forth by the public works committee.
This hasn't happened since 2016.
It was also a time when we were dealing with one proposed budget scenario, not four.
We now have differences expressed by the advisory committee members and preferences on the budget scenarios.
This makes it hard to determine what scenario to choose in the end, really to be as inclusive as possible with the Shawnee land community.
It would be to hear what members of the community have to say on this matter. I hope they will be given an opportunity.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I concur with what she said that I came down to this meeting special from Hagerstown just to be here.
We need to have more input into our budget and what the money goes to and just to public works making a decision for us.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Lenshmitt.
Hi, my name is Lenshmitt from Shawnee land back creek district. I'm here tonight to express concerns with the way Shawnee's lens budget has been managed.
Mr Wilder stated on February the 21st, 2020 that Shawnee land has over a hundred lane miles of road to maintain.
However, in a previous budget from 2018 page 10, it states there's only 50 miles of road to maintain.
He also stated that the elimination of a crew member would impact the current level of service the residents have come to expect.
Mr Wilder is not a resident of Shawnee land, nor does he pay fees towards our community.
So I ask, how does he know what the Shawnee land residents expect or what we are accustomed to?
Does he know what we are willing to do without and what we're willing to sacrifice?
At a special meeting held by the SSDAC, there were four different budget scenarios presented.
Supervisor Grabber attended this meeting as well.
Mr. Grabber, along with the SSDAC chairman Jimmy Smith assured the residents at this meeting that there would be no vote at the upcoming public works meeting on February 25th.
It was stated that it was just a discussion on the topic and the residents of Shawnee land would have adequate time to inform the SSDAC of their fillings on this issue.
However, in the absence of the Public Works Committee chairman, a vote was taken and accepted to do the original proposed budget minus the fee increase.
This action did not follow steps that should have been followed.
The SSDAC is just that in advisory committee. Their purpose is to advise the Shawnee land manager, Public Works Committee, and you the Board of Supervisors of the wants of the whole community.
This was never given a chance. With this being said, I feel that this should be returned to public works and the appropriate time allowed for the residents of Shawnee land to speak and voice their opinions.
Many residents fill betrayed by the county and the actions that took place.
This is not the normal standard nor is it what would be expected.
The residents work hard for the money that is placed in the budget and their voice should matter and should be taken into consideration.
Somewhere along the way Shawnee land residents voice has been taken away.
The establishment of the sanitary district with the county was with the understanding that the two would work closely together for the good of Shawnee land.
I ask you to return to this way by working with the residents and the community of Shawnee land so you can better understand where the residents are coming from and to help the process more sufficiently.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Brian Schmidt.
Brian Schmidt with the concrete district.
I just want to concur with what my wife said on the matter.
I ran a couple of numbers.
Our budget has been out of the line.
It has been closed to be balanced in the past five years.
The past five years our budgeting has increased 6 plus percent.
We had the one time fee increased offset it within the past five years.
It seems like the personnel operating expenses are essentially what's the main reasoning for the they've actually increased right along with the budget of 6.46%.
But let alone the manager has his salary has increased 19% in the past five years.
I've looked it up and the average cost of living in the state of Virginia has only increased by 1.3% in the past five years.
As a citizen who pays this Shawnee land fee, I would like to see where we have some community input and not see it inflated an unbalanced budget approved by not only the board of supervisors belong with the citizens of Shawnee land.
Again, there was that special meeting that was where we were advised on February 24th of 2020.
We were told in this meeting that public works and the board of supervisors were to meet on February 26th to discuss the proposed budget but not vote on it yet.
Public works decided to move forward with it without any community community input.
This information was provided to us by our sanitary district chairperson Jimmy Smith who sat in on the budget meeting.
He was unable to voice the community's concerns during this meeting for several social media posts.
All I'm asking for is just for some additional time to relook at the budget with the community's input to make the right decision on balancing the budget.
We avoided a fee increase this year but if we continue to budget beyond our means, at some point you're going to have to impose another fee increase.
I believe members of the community living on fixed incomes with that only 1.34% increase.
Social security would then be forced to make drastic financial decisions based on decisions where some people had no vested interest where they do.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Jeff Stevens.
Hi, my name is Jeff Stevens. I'm in the back creek district.
I'm currently a committee member on the Shawnee Land Advisory Committee. I've been for several years.
I wanted to make it known that I think with the budget two thirds, 500,000 of our budget of 800,000 is in personnel and I believe we have to reduce that by one to give us a little more money to accomplish projects.
And I think there's other areas that we can cut. We need to have community discussion and be able to advise and have some say so in our budgeting.
I think that's what we need to do from here on out. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Ed's Coleman.
Ed's Coleman, Kingsborough District. I'm here just to comment briefly on the last item on your docket tonight.
Winchester Medical Center's application, 06-19. I'm here on behalf of two adjacent property owners, Nancy Johnson and Carolyn Turner.
I'm here on four parcels immediately to the west off of route 50 and their properties were rezoned to B2 commercial in October of 2008.
And as part of that rezoning access was required for the development of that commercial zone property to use botanical boulevard, which is part of the Winchester Medical Center's property.
I believe that the location of the point of access for the entrance is established by documents that are in the record, which would include the Winchester Medical Center's master development plan that was approved in June of 2004.
Two subsequent deeds of dedication that were recorded in the land records in May of 2008.
And also the general generalized development plan that was submitted with with respect to the actual rezoning of the the Johnson and Carolyn properties, Carolyn Turner properties in October of 2008.
We believe that there is a quote unquote by right right of access.
The reason for my presence this evening is the application that's in front of the board tonight, as I understand it, initially contained a revised generalized development plan for the Winchester Medical Center, which deals with matters internal to their property, such as uses and elimination of a landscaping or a roundabout that are internal to the medical center's property.
And not really an issue of concern to Ms. Johnson and Ms. Turner.
What was and is remains a issue of concern is that initial revised GDP included a reference on it clearly referring to the access for the commercial properties that they own.
And and then further at the boards, I think January 8 meeting, there was some extensive discussion questions submitted to the applicant that evening about whether or not Winchester Medical Center recognizes the right of access, even some discussion about whether there would be a charge for the right of access.
There's also some discussion about the 14,000 daily vehicle trips per day that are tied to the Winchester Medical Center property.
And then after that discussion, it's our understanding that the applicant revised slightly its generalized development plan to eliminate the reference to the access.
And that's our concern that we want to make sure that there's nothing done with any approval or disapproval of this application that impacts or limits the right of access.
I will represent that Mr. Lawson and I have had a discussion today, and we're attempting to come to some solution.
And I think the medical center recognizes the right of access, but obviously that's up to Mr. Lawson in the medical center. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Is that all Miss Phillips?
Jimmy Smith.
Thank you.
Up a little bit.
Good evening, and thank you, Mr. Chairman and the board.
My name is Jimmy Smith. I'm from Back Creek.
Also, I'm the current chairman of the Shawnee Land Sanitary Advisory Committee, speaking on the buzzword since January the budget.
Back in November, the committee had a look at the budget that was to be presented.
We all agreed with it.
My thoughts that was a good working budget.
It was decreased by some $130,000 from the previous budget, with no fees increase.
That's great. The people can keep the normal with no life change with the fee increase.
People really do enjoy Shawnee Land.
People really do enjoy Shawnee Land and would hate to have things change up there.
The budget went to the public works meeting in December.
This is where the talk began to increase the sanitary fees to $300.
It was then voted down to $140,000 to increase the fees.
That totally caught the committee and the citizens off guard.
They're scared for the increase.
There have been many discussions on the budget over the past months.
Since then, there was another public works meeting with a vote to move forward with the budget with no fee increase.
Do I believe it can be fine-tuned?
Of course, anything can.
We all work together. It's a community.
I think it's a positive move forward for the citizens to keep all that we are used to with no fee increase with this budget in mind.
Thank you.
All right.
I ought to wait until the end of the meeting.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
That will bring us to the consent agenda.
How would the board like to handle the consent agenda?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I would like to make a motion.
We would move forward to approve the consent agenda with the exception of the removal of 6d6 delta.
Make it a separate item.
E.
You've heard the motion.
Sir, a second.
I'll second it.
And discussion.
Anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I thought the later in this item we do, we are addressing that under public works, are we not?
Sorry, do what?
I think we are addressing that issue under the public works.
This is the public works report.
I understand that.
The motion is to move it out of consent.
And we would move it into NAN.
We're fine, Mr. Chairman.
NAN C.
We're fine, Mr. Chairman.
You're good?
Yes, sir.
All right, further discussion, anyone?
All right.
Supervisor Grayward.
Aye.
Supervisor Dun.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Supervisor Fisher.
Aye.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
Consent agenda is approved as amended.
Item number 6d will move to NAN C.
Okay?
Okay.
We'll bring us to Board of Supervisors comments.
Are there any?
Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President McCartney.
Just to address some of the concerns I would just express by the citizens.
As a member of the Public Works Committee for the last two and a half years, I have to say I don't believe
that any member of the committee has any intention of being devious or backstabbing or betraying.
I think all of the members of our committee are very hardworking.
I think Public Works does an excellent job balancing the costs versus the results that they get.
They're one of the few areas of the county where they actually raise most of the money to fund their own budget.
So to the folks who are on the committee, I'd say thank you for the good work that you do.
I think that there's a single member of that committee who would have done anything to betray or backstabbing once.
I just wanted to set the record straight on that.
I think they're all fine people.
Thank you, sir.
Are the comments anyone?
Chairman, from A.
Yes, sir.
Supervisor Well.
I was the chairman when you were out.
And I just want to assure everybody that, you know, it wasn't anything personal and nothing now of what we normally do.
It's a committee meeting and we were having, we were dealing with issues as we saw them on the agenda.
I don't know why you were told there was no vote to be taken.
That was not what I was told as the temporary chairman.
I've been on this committee for years and years and years.
And the other thing is that it committee meetings, finance and all the other ones I'm on.
Public comment isn't a comment coming from people who work within Frederick County and need to have input from treasures of one so on.
But we don't go into public comment at that time.
The meetings could go on for a long, long time if we did.
So that wasn't the place to do that.
And some representative have been there representing John Eland and one that was a member of the committee or whatever they had, they were right to speak.
So just letting you know there was nothing underhanded or by intent or otherwise to keep you from doing those things that we just follow in procedure.
Thank you.
Any other discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
I had the same provider die.
So a couple of weeks ago, we had a joint school board board supervisor meeting.
And at that time, there was an agreement to have a follow-up meeting a week ago.
Then there was a decision that that meeting was not necessary.
But I know that I wanted to talk to school board members.
If the school board members that would like to talk to me or another board member would like to meet last Wednesday.
School board members came back and said that that was not working out for their schedule, which I understand.
I just want to say that Chairman Jay Porman called me initially in January and said, blank, can we just get together and chat.
And that was a highly constructive meeting.
We had a good discussion at McDonald's.
I shared with him some of my concerns.
He shared with me some of his concerns.
It was just a good one-on-one meeting.
And what I'm hoping to do is have the same type of meeting with the rest of the school board.
Just to sit down and chat and say, this is where I'm coming from and why.
This is what I say.
What do you say, et cetera?
I've attended two day long sessions in 2018 and 2019 for the school board or the training sessions.
I've gone and listened to what they've had to say.
They have some legitimate needs.
And I just want to have the opportunity to talk to those school board members and say, this is what I heard.
This would like to consider as options.
We are going through a budget process.
Because if more than three people show up, it has to be a public meeting.
I'll just ask Mr. Foreman to see if we can have his board go and join us possibly next Wednesday at four o'clock in this room.
If that does not work, I'm open to having it next Monday or next Thursday or next Friday or even Saturday.
If we can find some time in common ground to sit and chat.
There may be some other people on this board that would like to join me.
And for that reason, Mr. Chairman, if there's more than three of us would have to be a public meeting as well.
But I just want the opportunity to sit down with school board members and just go through face to face and say, this is where I'm coming from.
Here are my concerns.
What are your concerns?
And how can we work together to try to make the school system better and serve all further counting?
So if the school board members are listening to this or open to having a discussion with me, I'd really appreciate the opportunity.
There may be a couple of other board members as well.
But let's just have an opportunity to talk face to face across the table and go from there.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir.
Supervisor Graywood.
Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Two things of note.
I would just like to add on to what Supervisor Dunn has stated.
I also met with Mr. Foreman and had a very constructive dialogue.
And I would also like to meet with the school board staff.
Specifically, I've been told that there is a budget proposal, obviously not a budget.
And getting that information has been very elusive.
I know that there have been many other folks here who have asked for that information as of I to our school board superintendent.
That has been going on for in excess of 12 days now.
Some of that has been put forth as a FOIA's request.
There is a need for some open dialogue there.
And there's a need for some information to flow in order for us to have constructive criticism,
constructive relationship and criticize a budget and criticize what we think is good and criticize what we think is bad
and what we can find common ground on and how we can build.
That's the first thing.
Second thing.
I was the supervisor that met with the fine folks from Shawnee land on the 24th of February.
Prior to that meeting, I had spoken with the chairman of the Public Works Committee, which would be Supervisor McCarthy.
And he and I had come to an understanding that it was proper that we allow the fine folks of Shawnee land to have some input into the budget.
Since the budget had changed since they had seen it in November, the fees had increased, as has been mentioned here this evening.
And it was time to give the folks of Shawnee land a little of additional input since they had not had that opportunity.
On the 24th of February, we did meet and we, when I met with them and when Mr. Smith was there, we were told that at the February 25th Public Works meeting,
there would not be a vote on the budget that there would simply be discussion.
And that's what we conveyed to the overflow crowd at that meeting.
I was as shocked as many of those fine folks were on the 25th to find out that a vote had been taken.
And that is not a stab at anyone here.
I just believe that that information was not conveyed.
So what I would like to see as we go forward here, and that's why I asked to full 6D off and have some discussion about it a little later,
is to possibly go back and allow the process to function as it is supposed to function, which is the residents of Shawnee land,
to give their input to the Shawnee Land Advisory Committee.
The Advisory Committee gives their recommendation to the Public Works Committee.
The Public Works Committee gives their recommendation to us.
That was set up for good dialogue, good interaction, and I think it's a fair interaction, and I think it needs to occur.
And that's why we pull it off, and maybe we can speak of on 6D a little bit more when we get to it.
But I appreciate you being willing to at least pull it off and consider agenda and have discussion.
Thank you.
Further discussion, anyone?
Comments?
All right.
Move on to county officials.
Are you doing the introduction, Mike, or please?
Mr. Chairman, members of the board.
I come to unite as a Fredbury County representative to Lord Fairfax Community College Board.
I've been in that position for three years, and so I got to talking to Mr. Dibs, and we decided it was a good idea to bring the president forward to the board for an update sort of a current sort of a status what's going on with the college.
It's appropriate at this time because the college is 50 years old this year, if you can believe it, 50 years.
And you don't find too many residents in Fredbury County that haven't been a customer at one point or another in their life.
I put a handout at your stations that the president has brought tonight.
And I just want to point out, I'm sure she has gone to, that these are county numbers.
The college serves eight jurisdictions, but these are Fredbury County numbers on this sheet.
And as you know, in my other job in Fredbury County, item four is a particular interest with the enrollment.
It is just a tremendous opportunity.
So with that, I would like to introduce Dr. Blossor, president of Lord Fairfax Community College.
Thank you, sir. Welcome, Dr. Blossor.
Thank you.
I appreciate you taking time out to come and share with us.
Oh, I'm very happy. Thank you all so much for letting me just come and share a little bit about Lord Fairfax for a few minutes.
I will just have to tell you that when I left campus a little after six, my first thought was, oh, it is going to be so nice to come and talk about Lord Fairfax and not talk about the coronavirus.
When we had the first presentation, I thought, well, I guess we're all going to be talking about it for a little while.
But again, thank you. I wanted to thank you certainly for your appointments to our board.
It is certainly something that we need is local representation to make sure that we are addressing all the needs of all of our counties.
And so I want to thank you for appointing Mike Lake.
Thank you, especially because he actually agreed to also serve as our board representative on our foundation board.
So he is doing double duty for us right now and doing a great job.
And so we're glad to have him also want to thank the board for your support for our college board budget each year and that helps students in Frederick County to be able to have scholarship funds and other resources.
And so we thank you for your support of the college.
As I mentioned, you do have a snapshot in front of you. We try to do one of those for every one of our localities.
You will notice that the number of students, which is quite impressive, almost 1800, 1771 students were enrolled at Lord Fairfax just from Frederick County.
Your county is certainly the largest population of our students come from Frederick County.
He mentioned also we had 338 graduates last year from Frederick County and we additionally, that number if you're not familiar, we have 95 students who graduated from Lord Fairfax with a certificate or a degree before they graduated from high school last year.
So the dual enrollment program in in Frederick County is amazing. It is one of it is the largest that we have in our service region.
And those students are getting are able to complete at least a year of college or sometimes they're full associates degree before they ever finished high school, which is an amazing accomplishment.
I also always like to point out the fact that you can see our tuition numbers at the bottom tuition still at the community college remains on average a third of the tuition at four year institutions.
And if you put in room and board, we're often about a fourth of the cost of what it is. And with student debt right now, it's one of the things that we're really focused on.
We're spending a lot of time raising funds for scholarships. The new program that the state has come through with additional scholarship funds for community college students is going to help those who can't still afford the community college tuition, but we want to keep those students from having to take on debt as much as we can.
A couple of other things we do have adult basic education classes that are offered and English as a second language classes that are offered throughout Frederick County.
And that's something that we're very excited about that we're able to come into the county and offer those classes here for for citizens.
As Mike also mentioned, we are celebrating our 50th anniversary. So 50 years ago today, there was construction happening on our very first building in Middletown.
And I've gone back and read all the history and when they first started and where they were registering students down the road and the wayside in that was used for some of the meetings for the first board meetings.
And it's really exciting. We're going to be doing a lot of things this year to celebrate that 50th anniversary.
I will also share that we, when we started, when we opened our doors in September, we enrolled 571 students in that first semester.
And of that first academic year, we served about 900 students. So does anyone want to guess this academic year, how many total students and all of our programs we will serve? Any idea?
We will serve right at 18,000 students this year. And so when you add up all of our dual enrolled students, our students on campus getting degrees and certificates, our workforce students, our adult basic education students, we will serve about 18,000 individuals, which is quite a growth over that 50 years.
One of the things that's interesting too, we started out with the one building. If you haven't been to our Middletown campus recently, we now have five instructional buildings.
So we have grown there in size. We also have grown in the number of locations we have. We now have a campus, which we've had for the last 30 years in Morenton.
And we have expanded and we are building a new center right now. Construction actually starts next week, building a new center in Loray. And then we have a small center in Vent Hill in Faulkier County.
So we have four locations. And then we are in every single high school and then in other locations with adult basic education.
Something else that's changed a lot over this 50 years and really in the last probably 20 years is that we have of our enrollment just this semester.
We have 2,800 students who are taking at least one of their classes online. And we have almost a little over 1600 students who take all of their classes online.
And these are working adults who just need to be able to get classes and just can't figure out a way with childcare and all of the other demands of their life to be able to come to any of our locations.
And so they take those online. So we have certainly grown over that period of time. And again, I just want to thank you for giving me just a few minutes to brag a little bit about Lord Fairfax.
And I will open it up and answer any questions you all might have.
Questions.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate all you do and the way you do it.
Thanks for sharing with us.
Committee appointments, Board of Equalization. We have two who are willing and eligible. I would like to board like, yes ma'am.
Mr. Chairman, I would move that we appoint Kimberly S. Dodd and Ronald B. Schickle to the Board of Equalization.
Her demotion is her second.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And the second. Is there any discussion?
Thank you. They do a fantastic job.
They have been doing a wonderful job.
All right.
Supervisor Fisher.
Supervisor Carthy.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Supervisor Wells. Supervisor Dun. Supervisor Grayburn.
Chair votes aye. Motion carries.
And we'll reappoint Kimberly S. Dodd and Ronald B. Schickle to the Board of Equalization.
Tourism Board. We have a recommendation.
Would the Board like to handle this?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes sir.
I'd like to nominate Arthur Kerns to be the member on the tourism board.
He is a great businessman. He has great people skills. He wouldn't be an asset to the board.
I've known him for 20 years. And I think it would make a great contribution.
Thank you sir. You've heard the motion? Is there a second?
A second.
Is there any discussion?
Just informationally, this is a co-appointment with the City of Winchester.
They're scheduled to hear this also.
Yesterday.
They approved the nomination.
Thank you.
All right. All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed now.
We'll appoint Arthur Kerns.
All right. That'll bring us to committee business transportation committee.
Mr. Bishop.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the board.
We'll add up a little bit.
The first item for your consideration is the potential bridge closure for the reconstruction of the Bat Creek Road Bridge.
Over Bat Creek.
That is proposed take place in the summer of 2021.
V.O. is seeking board concurrence on a closure of the bridge as opposed to maintaining traffic during reconstruction.
If you were to try and maintain traffic during reconstruction, you'd be talking approximately double the price because you'd have to put temporary crossing in place deal with environmental issues.
And you'd also be talking at least double the construction timeline, which so you'd be talking more like eight months to even a year to actually complete the project.
The alternative route I was provided a map late this afternoon and I did also provide a printout of that to you all at the dice.
It can be a little to my mind deceiving because it shows a very long route.
I believe the measurement on there's 15.3 miles or something like that.
But the only reason you would ever travel that far is if you were starting on one side of the closed bridge and driving all the way around to the other side of the closed bridge.
So just word of warning on that.
I just want to thank you for doing a good job.
I have spoke with Ed Carter today about it from the Commonwealth from V.O.
And in reality, even though you see a 25 minute route time as it stated, it's actually a little more a lot closer to a 10 to 12 minute rerout time there.
It will likely be much less invasive to a person's schedule by doing this for four months than them being required to pull a blue card for the stream that would be required to pull to make changes there.
So I think that the route that's transportation committee has chosen is a good one.
And I thank you for the work involved.
And a part of that to be a motion can be I'll make the motion that we accept.
I'm just trying to clarify.
Any recommended approval.
I'll make a motion that we thank you except second second second is there any discussion.
Anyone? All those in favor. I pose no.
So the next item for your consideration has to do with the current round of smart scale applications.
That's where we're on round four now, believe it or not.
And we're in what's called a pre application window, which will run until April 3rd after the pre application window closes.
There will be a bit of a dead period.
And then in early June, we will pick applications back up again.
We'll have about two months, two months to finalize those applications before that window then closes in early August.
At this time for your district grant, which are the applications that we specifically manage.
The recommendation of transportation committee would be to do a modified round modified from what we did for around three application for exit 317.
Actually, the best way for me to describe this is as boiled down as we can get it while still trying to create a meaningful improvement at that interchange.
It is not a panacea. It is not the catch all solve all.
But it is trying to get that project down to a level of cost compared to a level of benefit that we can realistically get it funded under the program.
It is described in the agenda that would include the realignment of the northbound exit ramp from I-81 onto Route 11.
Of course, that puts it where Redbud Road currently is.
In addition, it would extend the left turn lanes both north and southbound for those exiting onto I-81.
And that's in a nutshell what that is.
The other two projects are frankly sort of maybe at this point.
We'd like to put them in as pre-apps as placeholders, but we think they're going to end up more as MPO or regional commission applications since we get to put those in there as well.
The reason for that is the small pot of money we're talking about district grant.
We're trying to put our very best foot forward and we're monitoring what other localities are doing.
Frankly, with in coordination with VDOT, we're trying to kind of come to a district wide agreement, if you will, where the localities that are participating are putting kind of their biggest need forward and through that cooperative process.
We kind of all get our need funded and then we kind of go fight it out for the bigger pots of money in the statewide grant.
So that's why those have asterisks next to them, but those would be once again trying for the roundabout at Old Charlestown Road in Route 11 as we did last time.
And the other one is the improvements at the intersection of Route 11 South, Shawnee Drive, which was actually our highest scoring nonfunded project last time around.
So we feel like that one can be competitive as you look at our regional applications through the district commission and the MPO.
We're looking at those two that I just mentioned as well.
In addition to that, we're looking to do a much larger exit 317 application that would be based off the MPO study that is nearing wrap up right now, but that would be a full interchange solution.
We hope we're about to bring that out for public comments and alternatives to that so that we would have what we need within the pre-app window to get that placeholder in there.
And then as we get to the final window, we actual application window, we'd be finalizing that application.
So that's the biggie for that one, but in addition to that, we also are working with the MPO on what's called a STARS study, which is targeted intersection basically upgrades, things like turn lane extensions, small cost effective, but big bang for the buck type applications.
So we're looking at one potentially to a long route seven once again through the regional bodies for that program.
Thank you, sir.
Questions of Mr. Bishop, anyone?
Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Bishop.
Yes, sir.
I am so glad to see this thing is showing me drive and the OPEC in church because it's only been about 18 years at V.O. It's known about this debacle there.
What are the details to help those folks get out there on from OPEC in church?
Is there a single singleization?
It would include the introduction of what we would call a split phase signal.
You'd end up with another signal pole there that would create the gaps you need so those folks can actually get out.
If you end up with longer signal times, not going to lie on that one, but you do get better service for those people that frankly are right now or cut off.
Another key of that project is it also adds an additional lane northbound across the bridge into the city.
So the capacity for getting those cars that are backing up at that intersection through instead of having to sit to three cycles is going to go way up.
That would be a new bridge.
You would have to upgrade the bridge.
And if they work that something with the commercial entity there, the light.
Actually, they think they can do it within the right away.
Because it's only on the northbound side.
Well, it's the access from that business that interferes with the city.
That one they're not trying to cut off.
They are looking at the seven or seven eleven.
That's the one you're referring to.
Yeah, we would be upgrading there.
Thank you.
Other questions of Mr. Bishop, anyone?
Committee is asking us to authorize staff to move forward with these.
Would the board like to handle the motion in a second? Is there any discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed? No.
We'll forward those.
Thank you, sir.
And not to jump in just to make sure it's absolutely clear.
We are currently only in the pre-application window.
We expect to bring more information forward as we finalize particularly if things need to be tweaked.
Or even if something kind of comes up out of the woodwork that VDOT and your staff think we should really take a look at.
Appreciate it.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
That will bring us to the item that we move from consent and get back to that.
Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I just point out that I think the 9C is really the approval of a report that came out of public work.
So I just want to lose sight of the fact that the report is accurate.
I think what Supervisor Graber would like to do.
I support.
I think that we do need to give some chance for feedback from the community.
But I just want to make sure that we don't lose sight of the fact that we do still need to approve the report that came out of public works.
I was going to add to Mr Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I was going to speak on the report a little bit if I may.
Surely.
Okay.
On item two, it's an attachment number one.
You go down and it's item two.
It's the budget scenarios for the Showny Sanitary District.
It says the committee discussed at length about the budget scenarios provided by staff.
The first sentence they're called may kind of off guard.
I was a little concerned that it was only.
The first sentence we'll get to.
Discussions from staff and not recommendations from those residents.
And it was my understanding.
At the.
February 11th meeting when we pushed that back to the public works committee.
That there would be impact from the residents or at least feedback from the residents.
And the recommendations would be heard.
And then the the public works committee would have.

I thank you, Mr. Sherman.
Thank you, sir.
She provides McCarthy.
Sherman, I'd like to make a motion, but I don't want to put off discussion early.
I would move to deny the proper request.
The motion is there a second.
Again.
And a second.
Is there any discussion?
Anyone?
Chairman.
Yes, sir.
There's one question from Mr. Lawson if I could.
A little late.
Go ahead.
Would you like the opportunity to work something with the attorney this year representing the Jason Landowner?
Because I heard you all been talking, but from what his comment was, you haven't come to an agreement on this issue.
I'm just asking if you'd like that opportunity.
I greatly appreciate the question.
And we have, Matt, and we've in fact talked as recently as today.
And I don't want to put words in Ed's mouth, but he can speak.
He doesn't know what he's asking for either.
So in terms of having time to meet and to discuss.
I think much needs to happen on that property or relating to that property as to what it is they want so that an agreement could be could be presented.
And again, most likely approved, especially if it passes muster with you all and with V.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Thanks for the question.
Further discussion, anyone?
Supervisor Fisher.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Aye.
Supervisor Slotter.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Oh.
Supervisor Dun.
Aye.
Supervisor Grayward.
No.
Chair votes aye.
Motion fails.
The request is denied.
All right.
Motion's approved.
Motion's approved.
That's different.
The rezoning is denied.
Okay.
Maybe I didn't state it very well.
Poor liaison reports are there any?
Yes, sir.
Just a little bit of an update on the airport at the last meeting we had three flight schools that came to us.
And two of those have already in the process assigning leases and other ones talking about some additional office facilities.
And don't know if you noticed in the newspaper with the STEM program which is encouraging young people to get interested in aviation because we have an extreme pilot.
Shorty's coming in this country over the next ten fifteen years.
So just let you know things are moving along with the your regional airport.
Thank you.
Yes.
Thank you.
Any other liaison reports?
Anyone?
All right.
This is a portion of our meeting.
We reserve for citizens to comment on any issue.
They might like to bring to the board's attention.
Sir.
We could have your name, magisterial district and limit your comments to three minutes or less.
Please, sir.
Meeting my name is Jason Crowesdale.
I reside in a well on the back creek district on the Shawnee land sanitary district advisory committee.
And I'm here today and thank you for your time and I will keep it brief.
Just to pretty much echo some of the concerns shared by Mr. Graber and also by my fellow residents and fellow committee members.
But the process does seem to be has due to the committee electing to raise the fee and then lower it.
My concern is the lack of a balance of the budget.
It would seem that although Mr. Wilder's letter, he says that sanitary district and budget have been well managed and maintained over the years.
I would submit and looking at the budgets that that is not the case.
It would seem that the budget is well beyond the resources collected in the fees.
It would seem that the fees continuously project that the.
Unimproved properties will will contribute 200,000 when 50% year after year do not pay.
And just to budget for 1.1 when you're bringing in 700.
Doesn't doesn't add up and I would submit that attachment D.
You know, budget for improvements would be the prudent way to go.
And I agree with the decision of the board of supervisors this evening to refer this back to the.
You know, we've already put the wheels in motion to announce another work meeting for our advisory board.
I would submit that there seems to be an inherent problem in that and that we are.
And according to Kevin, according to what is written in this budget and what you said there when Kevin is a huge part of the budget.
So Kevin, if he's in the room, it's going to take flat because people are talking about his pay, his truck, etc.
This was what happened at the last meeting.
But on the other side, we put forth this budget and Mr. Wilder said it was a prudent budget.
And yet immediately it was shot down by some of the people sitting up here that the reserve is high enough.
So if you're not budgeting enough year after year, you need to collect more money or spend more money.
That's my position and I think we need to work the sound. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Is there anyone else who would like to address the board?
Mr. Morris.
This Alan Morrison Gainesburg District.
I'm exhausted to spend the Bob's, the weaves.
The lawyers get paid by the result or by word makes me wonder.
To my point for tonight, though, my wife presented me a couple of weeks ago a copy of the Winchester star from three years ago concerning the board of supervisors and the budgeting process.
And when you read that article, it's deja vu all over again.
We are not making any progress on the problems that we have.
And there's only two possible solutions that I can see.
One, we find about five hundred million dollars and give everybody everything they want regardless of actual need.
Or we learn to constrain our budgets to what the county is able to support.
Our budgets are constantly filled with requests that go beyond reason in many cases.
I have never been in a budgeting process until I started attending the Frederick County budget meetings several years ago.
The departments make the request and it's up to the supervisors to do the trimming.
My basic business proposition has been we make our proposition management looks at it and says this is 5% 10% 15% too high.
Make it work and they send it back down.
We don't do that here because the county government and all governments doesn't request money.
We simply take money.
Words have meanings.
Our friend up here previously says you know words don't mean you know words have very specific meanings.
And we're not paying attention to what we're actually saying.
We are accepting requests without justification.
And then we're going to the taxpayer to raise the funds to cover it.
The justification process is poor.
What we lack in government is efficiency and measurement of efficiency completely missing in Tarley.
So what I want I'm a good guy I expect you to give it to me and if I don't get it I call on my people to come in and complain to you.
Now your job is hard.
I'm not trying to gloss this over.
But we really are having a serious problem of getting beyond where we were three years ago because the arguments, the concerns, the questions and requests are all the same.
Thank you.
Thank you sir.
Is there anyone else who would like to share with the board?
Yes ma'am.
I just want to say on a more positive note that kudos to the county for the meeting reminders email meeting reminders and the newsletter that you put out.
Thank you.
Anyone else.
Yes ma'am.
You'll need to pull the microphone up there.
This is wondering.
Lay is on meetings.
Lay is on committees.
With the big farmer, the lawsuit that's going to be initiated or has been initiated.
We have an interest to the board if someone proposed a state-wide initiative which would winchester for the county.
Kind of like a liaison of concerned citizens within the agencies that will be receiving some of the funds like social services north of western.
Besides the contingencies that we pay to the individuals I assume.
We're happy to receive your comments.
We do not do question and answer.
We don't.
You just ask a very complicated question which we appreciate the question but we're not going to do that.
I don't want to I don't want to answer.
I just wanted to throw that out there that miss janky did mention to me that sometimes you form another committee if the knee presents itself.
And I would think as you told me at the last meeting this could go on for years and years and years with the being paid out from big farmer.
I don't want to say that because it is complicated I guess on what.
And what I'm looking at is preventative measures.
You know because we don't want this to happen again right I mean.
I've always hated drugs and like I said it can be very insidious and you can.
You can be involved in naively not even know.
I know you give me your numbers I'm telling you but I just wanted to make it clear.
My stance.
Thank you.
But anyone else like to bring anything to the attention of the board.
Anyone.
Or do supervisors comments are there any chairman.
Yes I have several comments I'd like to make.
I would like to refer back to what supervisor Fisher stated earlier in the meeting and I.
I fully agree with it regarding some of the policies with the sanitary districts.
I believe it is hot time that we have a policy on how sanitary districts are run in our county.
We are fortunate to only have two sanitary districts so we don't have.
Some of our neighbors do five or six or seven different districts that are managed different ways.
But I think it would be very wise of us to get a subcommittee together or even a work group.
And ask one person from each one of the sanitary districts the two that are in the county.
The supervisors that represent those sanitary districts and maybe even someone from public works.
I would like to ask one person to sit down and come up with a policy on how sanitary districts are managed.
So that we have a plan moving forward on how we are going to interface with them.
Above and beyond just how the sanitary districts such as the shone sanitary district is elected managed.
That's totally different than how sanitary districts as a whole are managed from public works.
That's first comment.
Second comment is I've made comments several times through a budgetary process.
We need to get further and further in debt as a county.
This year we will likely be close to $300 million in debt.
Once we include the debt from the new Ailer middle school.
I've made comments that we could look at reducing our debt or reducing our budgets 5% and using that to help pay down principal.
One thing that I found of note today and found it very concerning.
I had a wonderful conversation with our school board chairman, Mr. Foreman, a really good dialogue regarding the budget.
And what I was informed of was something that really shocked me because he's the first person to tell me this was that the chairman.
I'm sorry that the superintendent of the schools starts with last year's budget and then adds what he believes is needed or wanted on top of that budget.
And that's what we are presented with.
I have asked multiple times for a copy of the budget, something for line items or something to allow us to see what is in the budget and have been repeatedly denied.
The school board chairman sent me a budget today and I ask him exactly what that budget pertained and he said, well, Mr. Graber, that is the budget that we are currently working off of in 2020.
And I said, Mr. Foreman, I appreciate that, but that's not what I'm looking for.
And he simply said, Mr. Graber, I'd like to clarify for you.
What our chairman does is take the budget, the current budget, so 2020's budget and what is being expended for teacher salaries, for transportation, for food, and then adds what he desires on top of it.
I think that is a kind of a sad way to go about preparing a budget because it doesn't appear that there is much thought or a lot of insight into what programs may need to be expanded, what programs need to be cut, and what could be done to improve the budgetary process.
And one of those items includes the school safety officers, which as we talked about earlier, was in place before the school resource officers were put in place.
This board made the motion or made decisions to implement a school resource officer in every school, which I think is a wise decision.
What we didn't do, however, was ask that the school system remove the funds or give back the funds, or we did not reduce the funds for the school safety officers.
And that is simply one area in which we could look at taking money from an area that may no longer be needed and put towards capital projects or improvements to the schools, where many teachers from my district have stated that there are issues, whether they be bathrooms that are not fixed, heating and air conditioning issues that are of concern or other sanitary health issues.
I believe that we need to have a very forthright conversation board to board with the school board and with this board.
And find areas where we can find common ground and meet their capital project needs.
And there are some areas I believe we need to trim to meet the needs in other areas.
And I'll leave it at that. Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir. Any other board comments, anyone?
All right. Thanks, Chairman Wells.
Thanks, Chairman. I'll move that we adjourn.
Thanks to adjourn. Second.
All those in favor, aye.
Aye. Opposed, no. We thank everyone for their time and their diligence and sharing with the board.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
