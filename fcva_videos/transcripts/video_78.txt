A few weeks ago, a human rights organisation published the transcript of a phone conversation
in which a native of Shanghai detailed the process and methods used in the CCP organ trade.
This individual is a permanent resident in the U.S.
described how his relatives in China attempt to bribe him to provide referrals to prospective transplant recipes here in the U.S.
Your resolution will help reduce this type of black market activity in all countries.
Once again, on behalf of 220 local residents who signed the petition to support this resolution,
I thank Frederick Cunning to taking this step to save lives and support human rights.
Your resolution will be a light shining in the darkness exposing the evil practice of organ harvesting in China.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

Jason Cruzdale, back to the district.
I'm just calling, or rather I'm appearing today just to speak briefly on behalf of James Smith,
who is currently on the Sony Land Sanitary District Advisory Committee.
It's typical in the past for people who are on the committee to be given an opportunity to continue serving on the committee.
But for some reason, his before his term is over.
He's a proposal of somebody else has been put there in his place.
I've emailed several of you about what Mr. Smith has accomplished in his last two years on the advisory committee,
including just leadership, organizing better communication.
We're organizing the open house that had to be put off because of COVID.
Just serving.
You know, there's not everybody even shows up at every one of these meetings.
And so far, Mr. Smith has done that.
And I'm on the board also.
And we've tried to be transparent.
We've tried to represent the community.
And we try to, you know, make sure that Sony Land is taken care of.
And I would like to see Mr. Smith be able to continue to that effort.
And I would also seek for transparency when people on this board choose to replace people.
You know, what's going on there?
There doesn't seem to be any communication.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you, sir.
That's the end of the list, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, ma'am.
The consent agenda.
How would the board like to handle the consent agenda?
Mr. Chairman, I would move for approval of the consent agenda as presented.
The second is there any discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Aye.
No.
We'll approve the consent agenda as presented.
Board of Supervisors, comments.

Unfortunately, at the same time, I was speaking to this board, giving you an update.

Chair votes, aye.
And the motion carries.
Well, take us to item number 10.
The Finance Directorate for General Funds and a county capital fund supplemental appropriation
in the amount of $3,204,306 dollars.
This amount represents prior year audit funds for budgeted public- pardon me.
I'm having a hard time seeing this.
This amount represents prior year audit adjustments to account for the debt right off for the
sanitation authority and fiscal year 2020 CARES funds for budgeted public safety salaries.
Per policy amounts in excess of 20% operating reserve at year end are to be transferred to
the capital fund.
No, local funds are required.
The committee recommends approval and I would so move.

Chair votes, aye.
And the motion carries.
Mr Chairman.
Also, in your finance information, I would like to recognize the Finance Department
under the leadership of Mrs. Schiffler, items number four, five, and six that were a
part of the Finance Committee agenda.
The Government Finance Officers Association, GFOA, has awarded the award for outstanding
achievement, for outstanding achievement in the popular annual financial reporting for
the year June 30th, 2019.
This is the 14th consecutive year that Frederick County has received this achievement.
And as Mrs. Schiffler mentioned at our meeting, this primarily falls under the leadership
by belief of Mrs. Kibler as the Assistant Director, but obviously Mrs. Schiffler oversees
that whole department and what a great job they do.
Item number five, the Government Finance Association, has awarded the award for outstanding
achievement for excellence in financial reporting for the June 30th, 2019, comprehensive
annual financial report.
This is the 34th consecutive year that Frederick County has received this achievement.
And lastly, we learned at the Finance Committee meeting on last Wednesday that the GFOA has
awarded the County the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award for the annual budget
for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2020.
This is the 34th consecutive year that Frederick County has received this award.
And as you all know from our budget session, Mrs. Place is responsible for that again
under the leadership of Mrs. Schiffler.
And I would just like to say what an outstanding job they do and they certainly help to make
all of our jobs a lot less stressful.
So thank you so much for all your hard work.
We appreciate it.
Absolutely, thank you all so much for your dedication.
All right.
It's my report, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, ma'am.
That will bring us to discussions of the Capitol Improvements Plan.
Ms. Perkins, what?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.
This is the discussion for the 2021-2026 Capitol Improvement Plan.
The CIP, it's a document that contains a schedule of major Capitol expenditures over a five-year
period, as well as a category for long-term projects which are six years out or more.
Now, the CIP, what it shows are project priorities from various county agencies.
They, it provides their projected costs, as well as projected timelines that construction
would follow if they were funded.
Now, just kind of quickly, the inclusion of a project in the CIP is in no way an indication
that it will be funded by the county.
The CIP is strictly an advisory document.
It is intended to be used as a Capitol Facilities Planning Document, not for funding allocations,
which come forward through budget cycles.
Now, project priorities that are approved in a CIP, they may change, cost estimates may
change, priority ranking may change, as different circumstances emerge.
And then projects, again, might not be funded during the fiscal years they're shown
in the charts.
Now, if the CIP, once it's adopted, it does become a component of the Comprehensive Plan,
as outlined in the Code of Virginia, which requires the public improvements be consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan, so that link is between the CIP and the Code of Virginia
with the Comprehensive Plan.
And the CIP also reinforces the connection between the Comprehensive Plan and future
rezoning applications.
Now, this year in our CIP, we have 54 projects.
They are from the schools, Parks and Recreation, Library, County Administration, Fire
and Rescue, Sheriff's Office, Public Safety Communications, Transportation, and Regional
Airport.
Now, these are broken up into three separate tables.
First, you have what's covered under the general government expenditures.
And then broken out separately are tables two and three, which are transportation and
airport.
And that's based on where the funding comes from.
The first table, general government, tables two and three are usually state and federal.
So, we'll go through all of these.
These are the same charts, tables that are in your agenda.
It goes through each project, the ranking, the school year projections and totals.
There are also a series of maps that relate to these tables for schools, general government,
Parks and Recreation and Transportation.
So where this has been so far, the Conference of Plans and Programs Committee discussed
this at their meeting on January 11th, and they did determine that the CIP is in conformance
with the conference of plan.
It then went to the planning commission at their January 20th meeting, and they also
determined that the CIP is in conformance with the conference of plan.
So tonight, we are seeking authorization from the board to schedule the CIP for public
hearing.
I would be glad to answer any questions, and there are a number of county agencies here.
Should you have any questions about their projects?
You have questions from Ms. Perkins, anyone?
Surprise.
Questions?
Thank you, ma'am.
So, staff's asking whether we think it's ready to forward the public hearing.
How would the board like to handle this?
Mr. Chairman, I would move to follow this request or comprehend the plan on for public hearing.
The motion is there, second.
Second, Mr. Chairman.
And the second discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor Graber.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
A lot of things here that I see on this Capitol Improvement Plan have concerns with.
They don't appear to be, in my opinion, essential government functions.
I believe is to educate our children to provide emergency services, whether that be fire, EMS, or law enforcement, or other needs.
To see some of the items such as an aquatic center and an indoor ice rink, which account for over $20 million combined.
And some other items on this Capitol Improvement Plan is very concerning to me.
Because not only might there be monies expended towards the planning or design phases of some of these projects, but monies taken away from other essential products that may be essential to the health and welfare of our residents.
I don't see an indoor ice skating rink being the most essential to the well-being of our residents.
I believe that we should take a good look at this Capitol Improvement Plan of $1.6 billion with a B, as it is currently proposed.
And trim out some of these items that are not truly essential services prior to having a public hearing on it.
Thank you very much.
Further discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. President.
I went through and read this, and there's some things in here that are good.
I think that we all ought to consider.
Greenwood Fire and Rescue is looking for money for an expansion.
Greenwood Fire and Rescue has one of the highest call volumes of any station in the county, other than perhaps Steven's city.
If that can be expanded and that stages happen to go and higher additional people, there's a long-term cost savings for that Capitol expenditure.
That's one issue.
I think we need to look at.
It's a revolving fund for Fire and Rescue, which gives them the opportunity to get access to money at a cheaper rate than they would otherwise.
And that million dollars that's tied up is freeze up money that cost us money for further professional expansion.
That's a plus.
So those are two items that I think are worth looking at.
I also have them some concerns on the schools.
Right now we have about $176 million of debt in the county.
It's $164 million of debt.
There's another $12 million of debt that we will are committed to paying.
We have some other liability as well.
The school is asking for $85 million and according to their schedule, they're looking to do that in the beginning of February.
They're looking for public hearing and a vote on that at the end of February, four weeks from now.
The schools had meetings with some of us, not all of us.
And I and another supervisor will have a meeting with the school board to discuss this.
But this should be something that is an open forum transparent.
So the taxpayer knows what's going on.
So the teachers know what's going on.
So I think that's a little bit of a bit of a proposal here to top priority for repairing Indian hollows not even on the CIP four years ago.
The second highest priority, James Wood expansion, was number four two years ago.
The number one concern, a new high school, is now number five.
So we start to change things around and make things difficult.
I think that we as a community need to have a public hearing to go into depth on what the request is, which may very well be legitimate.
On why these two items have come up higher than they were just a few years ago.
And before we have a vote on that, we need to go into that in depth.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Capital improvements, plan.
That's correct.
Yes.
Further discussion, anyone?
Motion is to forward to public hearing.
Supervisor Stegmar.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor Well.
Supervisor Dun.
Aye.
Supervisor Graber.
Oh.
Chair about its own motion carries.
We'll forward to public hearing.
Board Liaison reports, are there any?
Hearing none.
Citizen comments on any issue they'd like to bring before the board.
Is there anyone who would like to comment to the board?
Last chance.
Or do supervisors comments, are there any?
Supervisor McCart.
Earlier, the finance department does an excellent job and we've won these awards.
I would say that if there was an even more stringent award, we would be winning that one too.
I rarely ask questions of our finance department because they are so open with us about where our money goes and how it's spent.
And I just want to say that, you know, I'm critical of other boards.
Finance department is not sharing information.
I can never be critical with our finance department.
Mr. Tierney and his staff do go above and beyond getting us the information we ask for in a timely way.
In a very succinct, understandable way.
So while we may have books, this thick full of budgets, we actually understand what it is because you all do such a good job.
So I just want to thank you and the finance department for helping us in the citizens of Frederick County understand where our money goes.
You do a great job.
Thank you, sir.
Anyone else?
Thank you.
