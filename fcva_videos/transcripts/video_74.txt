2017 Strategic Plan that the airport has put together and is really the playbook on a lot of the maneuvers that we're out doing these days.
Some recent highlights we're able to work with a current existing tenant to negotiate a lump sum payment of certain rent to retire $177,000 in debt that has the effect on our proposed FY22 budget of alleviating $53,000 of expense.
So we're very excited about that.
Rental income is up about 29% compared to two years ago.
This is from a variety of reasons cleaning up certain leases.
We now have a hangar so we have a new asset that we can generate revenue from.
But that is a huge marked increase and has helped stabilize certain revenues and I got some charts that show some of that about how we're able to generate more income from non fuel sources, which again helps us support that goal of being financially stable.
We welcome two new fight schools this year despite a lot of the uncertainty of COVID.
These two fight schools arrow lead aviation ventures bring with them a great reputation both of them.
They're both being successful so we're very excited about that.
I see fight schools as indicative of the health of a general aviation airport.
So it's very exciting to have two that are supporting themselves.
The corporate aircraft association is an industry group.
They represent a huge margin of turbine aircraft operators.
We were able to earn a preferred designation from this group by way of a is actually a bid process and members had to vote us in to earn this designation to say that we we upheld certain levels of service and security and all those kinds of things.
In exchange we do offer a fuel discount from that and we've seen over 30 new airplanes since we've earned that designation comes through the airport just for for transit fuel purchases which is very exciting for us.
The final note there the operating subsidy from the county from FY 19 to 20 was reduced about 25% our proposed budget next year further reduces that as well.
We take that very seriously we a lot of what we do out there on a budget standpoint is to try to achieve self-sufficiency at least work towards it.
So those are that's a key goal that we share between all the localities that comprise the authority and the airport of course.
I know on gross revenues FY 20 it's currently being audited.
We actually established the highest gross revenues in six years that's despite you know COVID there's two months of double digit percentage losses of revenue that we we endured and still came out and finished a year on a high note.
And so we say as incredibly encouraging we know the airports like ours have a unique marketing message now in this COVID environment where folks might be more comfortable using small airports that are closer to their destinations versus larger more busy commercial service airports so very encouraging news there.
And where we're getting revenue is also slightly different from where it was a couple years ago.
We see fuel as a little bit more volatile it's more susceptible to downturns in the economy as we saw this earlier this year and it's not a big change but you can see some movement there in the pie charts where the cut of fuel is now a slightly less and it's being replaced with rental income and this is income from either direct aircraft leases in our new hanger.
We think existing leases that we've we've cleaned up and so we're trying to generate more from that non fuel type revenue which is a more stable environment than the fuel game as we know.
But there's a positive story there with fuel volume so comparing the first five months of these fiscal years you can kind of see a clear trend take place the orange and the blue bars are transient fuel sale so by transit they're not based that our airport they're coming through to either do business in the community.
We're stopped by just for fuel and you see all those trends we sell to primary types of fuel have gas and jet a and you see those trends on the upswing.
What I like though about these this chart here is that the base fuel sales is also increasing and that's from the ability to to accommodate more aircraft again in the large corporate hanger that we acquired.
But more base fuel sales again form a better backbone if you will of of revenues that we're very encouraged by.
I like to end on this note all the numbers and things are great but I really want the citizens and everybody to really take away the value of this airport is really the uses you see on the screen here are the most direct value that you generate our airport benefits everybody whether or not you ever leave the ground and it's because there are unique aeronautical purposes that we support that serve the public good that serve the public interest.
Even just this week we had especially care team come in at 10 o'clock and was with us until 3 a.m. and it was a team of doctors performing critical operations the Winchester Medical Center so we see that stuff on a daily basis you know that's that's the tactical level that our staff we live and breathe and it's a good story to tell and so we want everybody to understand that these are the things that come through the airport that we support on a daily basis and we're a better community for that.
So at that I will welcome and entertain any questions you have again I know I kind of went through those kind of quickly but you guys got quite an agenda tonight so thank you for your time and welcome you out the airport anytime.
Thank you sir any questions for anyone Supervisor Graber Graber thank you Mr. Chairman not a question just wanted to give you congratulations I have been to the airport I have seen some of the work that you've been able to do you have done a wonderful job trying to try to turn that airport around to where it can be successful.
I'm very thankful for the efforts in which you've put forth a job well done.
As we're done I'll just say Ibit you did a great job in the last couple years we've talked about that and we appreciate what you're doing the fact you're dropping the county obligation so Mr. Sabo you done a good job we really appreciate it.
Are there questions anyone come in no questions but just thank you Mr. Sabo and your board what a success story we've seen from your operation.
So thank you for all your efforts.
Thank you very much sir we very much appreciate your dedication and your boards hard work thank you again.
All right that'll bring us to 8c board of equalization we have a three year term vacancy and we have an application from Gary Kenzel Oats.
How would the board like to handle this?

The motion is our second and the second is there any discussion.
All those in favor aye aye pose no we'll forward that name to the judge.

Supervisor Stegma.
Is he a motion or if you're so true.
Mr. Chairman I'd like to make a motion to accept the nomination of Elizabeth Kozel for the unexpired four year term of Shawnee District representative.
And I have a couple of comments that I'd like to make when that's appropriate.
For dimension do I have a second second in the second in your comments.
Thank you chairman. Just wanted to say in support of the appointment of Mrs Elizabeth Kozel to complete the term on the planning commission of Mr Larry Ambrosey Shawnee District representative.
After learning of Mrs Kozel's interest in protecting and preserving the lifestyle traditions and values of Frederick County as our County grows.
I'm fully supportive of her appointment to the planning commission until April 28th 2021 to the end of Mr Ambrosey's term.
Thank you.

I guess I'll start over. I apologize, Mr Chairman. We've been living under COVID for
nine months now. One of the many elements that we at the administrative office have had
to deal with as a result of that is funding that we received down from the state and federal
government through the CARES Act, which has been a blessing and a curse. There's been
constant changes in interpretation guidelines issued literally weekly on how the money can be
used, what it's appropriately used for. Guidelines are oftentimes contradictory if not flipping back
and forth. Out of all that, one of the elements is this prospect of providing hazard pay
to employees of localities. This opportunity arose myself and key members of my staff,
county attorney, finance director, HR director and others have grappled with how we might
make use of those funds to provide that hazard pay for a variety of reasons and a variety of
complicated nuances and conflicts between guidelines that come with the CARES Act funding,
Fair Labor Standards Act, et cetera, et cetera. We finally concluded after multiple meetings
that we just could not see our way clear to provide hazard pay to our employees.
Many of our surrounding localities have provided various forms of hazard pay and or bonuses.
We chose and felt that we just couldn't find a way to do utilize CARES money to provide hazard pay.
So with that as background, on November 20th, we received a memorandum from the state
compensation board. As a result of an amended budget adopted by the governor, we as a
locality have been directed to pay a $500 bonus to all compensation board funded sheriffs,
sheriffs deputies, superintendents and regional jail officers. Now to the uninformed that may
seem like a great thing, but the problem is that many of our jail and sheriff's positions are not
compensation board funded. In fact, 163, only 163 out of 190 positions at our regional jail are
comp board funded and only 67 out of 155 of our sheriff's department positions are comp board
funded. So what that means is if we follow the mandate and provide that $500 bonus to those
comp board funded positions, we will be in a position where we are paying perhaps deputy A
a $500 bonus, but not deputy B because deputy A happens to be a concord funded slot and deputy B
who performs the same tasks and same job is not in a comp board funded position.
So with that, our initial proposal, let me go a bit further if you would. In addition to that,
none of our fire and rescue positions are comp board funded and I think we all know that our
public safety positions also provide a similar service are in as much exposure if not more in
many cases to COVID. We also have many other positions, our department of social services to
regular house visits, our inspections department are in the field on construction sites daily
and the list goes on and on. Our treasurers, office tellers are dealing with people face to face
every day, our receptionists, so our compact site workers. So when we start looking at where do we
draw the line on who should we include in this $500 payment, it became very complicated. To add to
that, we have to do this by the end of December. So we don't have a lot of time to do a lot of
research and a lot of gyrations and calculations and such. So our proposal was and as it reflects
in option one, I'm sorry, option one was just to fund strictly the comp board positions as
directed by the state. For the reasons I've just discussed, we didn't feel that was appropriate.
Option two, well admittedly not perfect, was to simply provide a $500 bonus to all county
employees. That would require in addition to the funding we'll get from the state for the
comp board funded positions, it would require additional transfer from our contingency fund
of some $278,000. Going one step further and trying to recognize the distinction
between a typical office job and some of these other jobs I've listed that are inconsistent and
close contact with folks who may be COVID positive. We also proposed at a future date because we
don't have time to sort all this out. A second $500 payment to those employees who are
in positions that are characterized as high or very high risk for exposure to COVID. We have
roughly 300 of those positions that have been classified as high or very high risk.
If we were to do that, it would require an additional appropriation of $152,000.
In total, what we had proposed to you and what that ordinance reflects is a one-time payment
to all county employees of a $500 bonus and a second payment of an additional $500.
To those employees who fill positions that are either at high or very high risk.
And I would just simply conclude by saying that well, we did not use CARES funding to do a
hazard payment as I discuss when I started out. We have used CARES funding to supplement
and offset many of our budgeted public safety expenditures, which that amount total between
last fiscal year and this roughly $5 million. So our fund balance as of right now and our
contingency fund is at $2.6 million, and partly because we were able to offset other budgeted
expenses through use of that CARES Act funding. And I would also point out that when all this
COVID stuff hit us, we were wrapping up our budget process. And initially, we had a 2%
COLA budgeted for our employees at a cost of about a million dollars. We withdrew that,
struck it from the budget. This bonus payment, as proposed, would have a total cost to the
county somewhere in neighborhood of $400,000. And finally, I would say, well, many of our
neighboring jurisdictions have closed certain functions and or close their buildings down to the
public. Frederick County has remained open from day one. We have not closed down any functions
and we have not denied access to the public to any of our facilities. So will I realize this is
this is a controversial proposal, and it is an expenditure of county funds, I felt that I
needed to provide some of that background for you. And I'm happy to try and answer questions,
and I have the finance director here to help if I need it. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Any questions of Mr. Tarrini? Anyone?
Thank you, sir. Would the board like to handle this request?
Mr. Chairman, it's a public hearing item. I'm sorry? It's a public hearing item.
Okay. Yes, I see it.
So this is a public hearing, would anyone like to comment concerning this proposed
payment? Anyone at all? Anyone? Seeing no one will close the public hearing portion of the
discussion. Board? How would you like to handle this one? Mr. Chairman, would you like
to take them in four by options? Option one, two, and three.
I think you're two. Or three. Okay, so sure. So I will make a motion for a approval of option number one.
Her dimension is our second and the second discussion. Mr. Chairman, can we clarify what
option number one entails? Option number one was the state mandate where they have actually
provided funding for a state mandate, so no local dollars.
And that was strictly for a comp board position, said as county administrator Tarrini pointed out,
you may have one deputy A as a comp board and deputy B not. So correct, Mr. Tarrini.
If I'm understanding the question, what option one was to fund solely those positions that are
comp board fund, so there's no local funding at all. It's just what we would receive from the
comp board. That was from the governor. So that's yes sir. That's one of those no decision.
It's there. We really have no choice in that one. That's her supervisor done. And Mrs.
Slaughter, my understanding is that this is already funded and it's mandated by the governor,
passed by the general senate, passed by the governor and signed into law, correct?
That is our understanding from the memos that were presented in our packet.
Further discussion, anyone? We have a question from Mr. Tarrini.
So this is exclusively the state compensation board bonuses. But that is incorporated in option
three. Is that correct? Or option two would have gone beyond option one and provided
provided a $500 bonus to all county employees. And that has a transfer from our contingency
fund. It would require a transfer. I'm sorry from our contingency fund of $278,000
in addition to the $101 from the state.
Saying that's an option two, correct?
That's sir. Okay, thank you. Further discussion, supervisor done.
So this comes to a bigger issue. We're all taxpayers. We're all subject to the same
COVID issues as well as the flu and everything else. And so I'm going to oppose this.
I know it's been passed by the general assembly but it's our tax dollars that are going into this.
I think it's inappropriate for the governor to go and shut down businesses and then provide a
bonus to those in the public sector. We're all in this together. I have a barber that was shut down
for three months. He works 12 hours a day, six days a week. And he said to me, Blaine, how do I
survive? I know a person that does my wife's hair. She has a couple kids. She was shut down.
She still has to pay rent. She still has expenses. She still has to feed herself. How she's survived.
I know a person that works for a restaurant or did work for a restaurant past tense.
That was a person's second job, not first job. That person is no longer employed.
I know business owners have lost significant dollars in their businesses because of this COVID issue.
And so I find it inappropriate for a government official, such as the governor,
or the general assembly, to take taxpayer dollars and give it to them when they're people
that are paying those dollars. I'll give you one example. I have a person in my district
who's lost his job. He still has to go and pay real estate taxes. And when he goes out and buys
something, he's still paying a sales tax for food and a sales tax for anything he buys,
all of which goes into the general assembly. So therefore, I think it's inappropriate. And if
the governor wants to go and give his own money, that's fine. But I think it's inappropriate to
take public money and give it to one sector when there's so many other people in the private sector
that are providing the dollars for that that are losing their jobs. I think those in the public
sector have done a great job. I think that those who have been deputies, who have been firing
rescue people, we appreciate their service. But they have a job. They can still pay their rent,
they can pay their mortgages. And I can name you on dozen people that do not have a job. And so
that's for that reason. I think this is inappropriate, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Further discussion, anyone? Mr. Chairman? Yes, sir. Supervisor Stegmar.
I'm going to be supporting whatever options involve providing bonuses for not only the compensation
board people, but the others who were left out. And then to take a look at the additionally,
those who have been working in very high risk, high and high risk jobs by saying the following.
The state compensation boards bonus for some reason does not cover 27 employees of the regional
jail, 88 employees who work in our sheriff's department. And any of our firefighters,
our emergency medical services, employees, and others who work in our county fire and rescue
departments. This is an unfairness that only the county can correct through this board action.
Secondly, I certainly understand the concern raised by
Supervisor Dunn and others that who have contacted me personally, which is that there are small
business owners who are struggling to survive without relief. All I can say is that the federal
cares money would be available in the form of more paycheck protection plan monies to keep
employees hired. And I'm going to be political here if only House Speaker Pelosi and Senate
majority leader Schumer would put politics aside and support the Trump administration's
latest proposal that would also include $600 for every individual American.
Regrettably, these individuals are unlikely to agree to anything until after the Georgia primary
election on January the 5th, since they don't want to risk the possibility that any credit would be
given to President Trump or to senators leftler and Purdue in passing such a COVID relief package.
Thank you. Are there discussion anyone? Yes. Mr. Stegmar's comment, the people that I just mentioned
got no relief from CARES. So some people have, but that CARES money has not gone down to a number of
small businesses and they still have jobs, they still have mortgages to pay, etc. Thank you.
Mr. Roosevelt, Carth. Thank you, Mr. Schumer. To put a finer point on it, CARES money comes
from the same pockets as the money that's being mandated to be spent in this proposal. I think
the greater point is that we're carving out a select few members of our society in saying we're
going to give them extra right now because they're dealing with the same pandemic that everyone
else is dealing with. My employees come to work every day and deal with the same pandemic
that other employees have to deal with. My children go to school and their teachers have to
deal with the same pandemic that the teachers in the Frederick County Public Schools have to deal
with. So they're to start a car about special groups that are entitled to receive money.
I think is a bad thing where this is not a fire or a flood or a disaster where only the
firefighters and the sheriffs have to go to it. Everyone is in this disaster together
and the brunt of the impact is going to be felt by the taxpayers who are in the private sector.
The U.S. Census Bureau is statistics right now show an almost two to one difference in job
loss and salary wage loss between private sector and public sector jobs. I think we all appreciate
the work that the public sector does, but they're secure. They're somewhat immune to these types of
things because we have the ability at the point of a gun to collect taxes from people
and pay the salaries of the public sector. The private sector doesn't have that option.
So I'm opposed to this just because we're carving out winners and losers those who receive
and those who have to pay. And I'm opposed to it. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you, sir.
Further discussion, anyone. Supervisor Grieber. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I'd like to reiterate
the points that Mr. Supervisor has done and Supervisor McCarthy has made both very well taken.
We voted a few months ago or some members of this board carved out some special interest
for data centers and gave them a special tax break. I don't believe that we should carve out
special interest for anyone. I think that we need to treat people fairly. If we want to look at
a fair resolution to this, we look at our employees as huge assets and they have been
wonderful assets through this pandemic. But as Supervisor Dunn has laid out,
there are many of our residents who have not been able to maintain a job or maintain
anywhere close to a normal working schedule because of this pandemic. I believe a greater use or
better use of these $500 might be $500 tax reduction to every resident to allow them to make it
through these difficult times to have a Christmas for their children to have other items that they
may not be able to have a roof over their head, food on their table as a result. If you will go
look at your local food lines, the food pantries, they have been growing ever longer.
Some of them in which I've spoke to have said we've had three to four times the demand in which
they have seen in previous years at previous times. We need to be very cognizant of the people's
money and that is what we are dealing with here is the people's money. Thank you.
Further discussion, anyone? Hearing none?
Supervisor Graber? No. Supervisor Dunn? No. Supervisor Wells?
Chairman, I just want to be sure we are on number one which is a mandate if you will from the
state of Virginia. I don't know that we can not do that and that's the reason I vote yes to that
number one. This is where we are, Compt Board, funded from the governor only. Correct. Supervisor
Swad? Aye. Supervisor McArthur? Yeah. Supervisor Stegmar? Aye. Chair votes are in the motion
carries. Now we have the second set which is all of our employees. How would the board like
to handle that? Chairman, I will make a motion for approval of option number two.
The motion is our second. Second. In the second. Discussion?
Anyone? Supervisor McArthur? Chairman, I can understand to a certain extent the
passing of the first one because it's a mandate from the state. This is not a mandate from the state
nor is it in the spirit of the mandate from the state which seems to me that that was what we're
trying to correct was a discrepancy between some in very high-risk jobs versus others who are
in very high-risk jobs who wouldn't receive the payment. So to me this seems superfluous to give
everyone in the county a raise when the argument for making the raise in the first place or the
bonus in the first place is because folks are in very high-risk situations. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Further discussion, anyone? Supervisor Doug? Mr. Chairman, if the General Assembly had
wanted to include everyone they could have. So for those such as Deputy A versus Deputy B,
if Deputy A gets $500 maybe he should share that with Deputy B if this does not pass.
The General Assembly could have determined who and what did they chose not to do it and for
the reasons I stated further I'm opposed to this. Thank you. Anyone else? Further discussion?
Mr. Chairman? Yes, sir. Supervisor Stegmar. Is it possible for me to ask
a question at this point because if we pass option two would that be with that preclude
going to option three or are we talking about going to option three as well?
I think that we split the two questions and that we'll go to the third. Okay, thank you.
Further discussion, anyone? I'd like to ask a question if I may as well just for clarification.
If we move to option three as I understood it, are we going to be able to fulfill a payroll to
address just the high risk personnel within the time frame that we've been and if we did not
move forward with option two? Thank you, ma'am. So option three is harder to administer
because we are going to have to go through 800 employees and try to figure out which one of them
has a high and very high classification. That can be done but not by the similar 31st.
With this payroll, we run payroll on Friday and then the next ones we run it in 13 days.
Within that time is weekend so I have two days to process a special payroll. So if you are
going to do option three it's outside of the December 31st.
Mr. Chair.
Questions? Yes, sir?
To follow up on Ms. Schiffler's comment, I think if there is a desire by the board to do
something along the lines of the question from Supervisors Stegmeyer and Slaughter,
the board has already passed the $500 that's mandated which the finance department will
obviously have to process that for the comp board designated positions by December 31st.
The board could adopt option three for all the other high risk, very high risk positions
but it won't be paid for what Ms. Schiffler said until well we put March 31st in the draft just
to give time to go through that process. So what we would have is those employees who are mandated
by the state would get their $500 by December 31st. The others who fall into those two categories,
the high risk, very high risk, would if the board approved that would get the $500 just not until
sometime closer to March 31st. So what makes that a little bit more complicated
is the majority of those positions at the regional jail are not high risk.
So we are paying medium risk employees as well. That makes it more complicated.
I have 12 people at the jail that are high risk. The rest of those people that are being paid
and are by comp board are not. Other questions from Ms. Schiffler, Supervisors McArtheon?
I would just I would commend the intentions of the staff to take care of county employees
but again this is an error on the part of our general assembly that I don't think should be
borne by the taxpayers of Frederick County which is the reason I will not support this second option.
Other questions from Ms. Schiffler, anyone?
Of one more. Yes. With option one approval, would the option one approvals who would receive
the $500 would they still be included in the option three?
So the way these options are written is that they build on each other. So option one is comp board.
Option two includes the comp board positions and everyone else at missed.
And option three comes back and revisits the positions that have a high or very high classification.
Do that answer your question?
Mr. Chairman, Ms. Schiffler did answer the question but the options are what the board makes the
options. The board is not bound by particularly defined options. If you want to redefine the options,
that's your prerogative. Chairman, questions? Yes.
Schiffler, so just to clarify, so those who are covered by the comp board mandate and if option three
were instituted would receive a $1,000 bonus and everyone else would receive a $500 bonus,
is that correct? So like the jail, so like the jail employees that are comp board,
they would only receive $500 because they are a medium class, a grade. But they're both.
They're both descracked. So they would receive $1,000. That's correct.
As you're done. Not as a comment, not to Mr. Schiffler.
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm Mr. Interpretty. Mr. Chairman.
Yes. I might one other thing is in response or follow up to Supervisor McCarthy's comment.
The board could, if that result, if the board felt that result was unpalatable,
the board could rewrite option three to exclude from its eligibility those who've gotten the $500
under option one. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Chairman, just as a response to the suggestion. That's where I have a problem.
I think you're taking the intent, which was to reward those who are in high risk situations,
like a sheriff who's responding to an emergency and has to deal with someone who potentially
has COVID versus someone who may be sitting in a back office somewhere not dealing or sitting
at home working. And I think that's a disparity that the legislature did not intend,
or did intend, they intended that the disparity to exist. So I appreciate the suggestion,
but I think it defeats the spirit of the mandate in the first place.
Further discussion, anyone? Questions of Ms. Schiffler?
Thank you very much. Helpful, I think.
I'll hang around a little bit.
All right, well, the motion for option two was that all of our employees,
which is the motion and the second that we're discussing. Supervisor Dunn, $500 does not
prevent you from getting COVID, $1,000 does not prevent you from getting COVID. If that were
the solution would be all for this. So just recognize this is money, but it doesn't deal with
the medical issue that we're dealing with. Thank you. Further discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. With this additional information, my sense is that for me,
anyway, what might be more fair after having approved option one is to make an amendment
to option three, which which I would do when we get to that. All the motion, if that
would address your concern, and I would be happy to do that.
Okay, I didn't hear you change the motion that we're currently discussing.
Is there any further discussion on the current motion?
Are we ready? This is all of our employees. Supervisor Graber.
Supervisor Dunn. Supervisor Wells. Supervisor Stey, a slaughter. Supervisor McCarthy.
Supervisor Stegmar. Chair votes no. Motion fails.
Any additional motions? Are we ready to move on?
We'll move on. Pardon me. Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to move for option three with an amendment.
Stated as you would like. That we include high, medium high and very high risk employees.
That for may I ask a question?
Surely. That is if they have received the bonus in option one to receive an additional $500.
Yeah, I'm not making a change to that. I'm sorry, but yeah.
So clarify. So yes, the answer is to cover the other high risk folks.
Make sure they are covered, or are you trying to give an additional bonus to those who are already
covered by the Comfort Commanding? I was making certain that those who are medium risk would be
included in this consideration for the additional money so that if some of them were covered already
by the compensation board, that would be an addition, but I would like to include all of them
in this further consideration under option three. Okay, so let me try this. If I understand where
we ended up on your motion, your motion is a $500 payment to high and very high risk who have not
received Comfort money or you want to include the Comfort people. It would be for medium high
and very high, medium employees. That's right. Okay. Whether they receive monies under the Comfort
or not, this would be an additional $500. Okay, so the motion as I understand it is to award the
$500 payment to medium high and very high risk employees, which will happen after the first of the
year. So, so let me tell you what can I tell you with that motion. That's what it does to you
is why I'm asking. So we have approximately 600 of the 800 employees that are in medium and above.
All right. So that's how many people that you would be covering with this number three.
You will also be paying people that are medium, Comfort twice the amount as you are paying
an e-m, a fire and rescue employee that is the only classification of very high. So I just
wanted you to realize that that's what this does. It's a mess.
Mr. Chairman. We have not gone to a second yet and we're trying to clarify the motion.
I will wait for a second to make my comments, sir. Thank you, sir. I'm trying to clarify the motion.
Is it stated as you wish? Medium high, very high, irregardless of Comfort payments.
I don't have a problem with that unless other members do. Okay, so that is the proposed motion.
Is there a second? I will second it. And we have a second discussion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I think the motion is completely irresponsible. When we have a paramedic that is down
innovating a patient and intimately close to that patient and having to receive the blowback
or any other airborne particulate from that innovation receiving less money than somebody who
is at medium risk, that is a disgrace and a slap in the face to that paramedic who has to do that
work. From what I just heard Ms. Schiffler, if that is accurate, that paramedic will get $500.
Somebody else who may be at a medium risk will be getting double that. Is that correct?
That is correct. I feel that the work that our men and women in uniform are doing every day
to try to keep us safe. I know that they went to one of my neighbors who has COVID.
They put their life on the line to tell them they're getting half of what somebody who may be
sitting at a desk is getting is absolutely wrong. I don't really have much more to say other than
I just cannot believe that this motion was made with that type of an understanding of that's
what our men and women in uniform are going through. Thank you.
Further discussion. Anyone?
To provide your starter. So if we took out the medium risk, Cheryl, does that put us in a better
position? So if you take out the medium risk, you would be avoiding doubling those that are
contboard-funded medium risk. You would eliminate that. You would still be giving a person twice as
much that is high risk than a person that is very high risk because your fire and rescue is very
high and most of your sheriff is high.
Yes, sir. Supervisor McCarthy.
Again, I'll read her how much we appreciate what our first responders do,
but everything they do is high risk. When you walk into a fire, you're putting your life on the line.
When a police officer shows up at a call, they never know what they're going to be dealing with
the sheriff puts his life on the line every day when he walks out of his house or she walks out of
her house and gets in that car and puts that badge on. And we don't give them a bonus for doing it.
We give them our appreciation and we pay them the salaries that they've agreed to take.
I don't see that the writ, I mean, yes, there's a new risk that's there, but it's no different than
the terrorism risk that wasn't there 10 years ago or 20 years ago. It's no different than the
chemical risk that we weren't aware of that weren't there 20 years ago, 30 years ago that now we're
aware of. I just see this as a mess. I agree with Mr. Schiffler. This is a mess and it's been
borne by our state government, which that's what they do. They create messes and they expect us to
then pick up the tab and fix it for them. So I just think this is a mess and we just need to
deal with a mandate and move on from that point. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir. My personal opinion is that we need to treat our personnel equally. Period.
If you'd rather have done a concur with what Mr. McCarthy has to say, love for the reasons he's
dated. Thank you. Mr. Chairman. I just feel like I just want to let the board know we
knew this was a mess. We tried to do the best we could to make it palatable and I realized
there's all kinds of issues, but I do feel somewhat responsible for putting the board in this
predicament and I'm sorry for that. We tried to bring you options that gave you some flexibility
but we were trying to make the best out of bad situation. Mr. Attorney, I don't think you
need to apologize. I think you're doing the best you can for your people and coming up with
options and giving us options to look at. This isn't your mess or you're making so I don't think
you need to apologize to it. Where are we? It's a further discussion on the motion.
Half of the question. Supervisor Graywood. Now,
Supervisor Dunn. Okay. Supervisor Wells. No. Supervisor Slotter. Supervisor McCarth.
No. Supervisor Stegmar. No. Chair votes, no motion fails.
I do think that we need to treat our personnel equally. They'll work hard every day for us.
Mr. Chairman, if I may, is there an opportunity for us to review this again and bring it to our next
meeting because it didn't need to happen until March 31st?
So, option one has to be done now. Understand. Anything above option one can be further reviewed.
Okay. Unless I hear something differently, we'll revisit this issue or not
at a future day and time. Supervisor Dunn. For those people on the
comfort that do get money. As the administrator said, you have deputate and deputate. Maybe deputate
shares his money with deputate. He's still coming off from us to taxpayer dollars. So,
if you want to make things equal, then there's an opportunity for those that have received that
money to distribute among everybody else that's working. Thank you.
Comments. Thank you, Mr. Chair. We'll move on.
That would bring us to, unless I miss something, CUP-0802-0. Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. My members are bored. This is a conditional use for
permit request for a special event facility. Just to refresh your memories, this was
actually looked at by this board in September 9th. It's brought back to you to clear up some of
the conditions, but I just want to run through real quick if I can. It's located on 1147 North
Parkour Road. It's on 117 acre farm that includes a single family detached resident, an open
outdoor patio, and a 2,400 square foot barn. Again, this conditional use permit would allow for
for special weddings, events, birthday parties, chair events, and family reunions.
And again, just to refresh your memory, this is a map of the area off of Parkour Road of the
Anchorage that's been considered tonight before you, Mr. Chairman. I'm Mr. Chairman. Again,
September 9th, 2020, public hearing was held on this proposed conditional use permit. The
conditional use permit was postponed from 90 days out of applicant to address concerns that were
raised by adjoining property owners and board members. And number three, there was some dialogue
between the representative of the district and the planning commissioner of the district and
with some of their adjoining property owners, which will be included in your conditions for
this condition and use permit. And so the board find this used to be appropriate. Again, the
following conditions should be assigned to the conditional use permit. Number one, all review
agencies and comments will be complied with it all times. And number two, an administrative sketch
plan in accordance with the requirements of Article 8 of the Frederick County zoning ordinance
shall be submitted subject approval by the Frederick County prior to status from the special
event permit. This plan shall show all improvements in a tree by planning buffer by agreement
by the adjoining property owner. And this buffer shall be planned within 12 months. The
approval of the conditional use permit and the applicant should maintain the buffer
in good health and repair for the duration of conditional use permit. This was an additional
condition. It was kind of expanded from what you seen originally on September 9. And this
was through agreement of the property owner meeting with the community meeting with Mr. Grayberg
and the planning commissioner for that district. Number two, there we know cabins of any size
permitted with this property. The applicant shall have up to two pavilions no greater than 24 by
24 for events. One monument style sign with a maximum sign here and not exceed 50 square feet
and to not exceed 10 feet in height. And again, the original application had come in for
possible future cabins. That has been taken off. And that's why that was added there.
In this number four, special events Sunday through Thursday show occur between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m.
Events on Friday and Saturday show occur between the hours of 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. The applicant
will allow one hour post event shutdown times is listed above for all guests and vendors
to the park property. The applicant is responsible for ensuring that any person for whom the ABC
license is required in order to serve alcohol has been attained. Number five, the special
event may accommodate no to not exceed 250 persons. The noise of any event should not be greater
than 50 decimals from the property line and no cell whiffers should be utilized for any of the
events. Number six, this conditional use permit will be reviewed by staff at the 122460 month
anniversary dates for compliance in the signed condition to use conditions. If there are two
or more violations of any of the conditions of the conditional use permit within a 12 month period,
this conditional use permit shall be scheduled for revocation from the Board of Supervisors
via the planning commission. Number seven, an expansive modification use will require a new
conditional use permit. Mr. Chairman here to answer a question to you or any board members may have
on this proposed conditional use permit for a special use facility. Thank you for any questions
of Mr. Chair and anyone. Mr. Chair, if this board voted no on this, the applicant would be
able to come back in a year, is that correct? That's correct, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chair,
earlier Mr. Presipino stood up and expressed some concern about noise. Will any of the buffers or
any of the restrictions in this address his concern? Yes, we have the decimals which were added
here, no outside of subwoofers for any on activities. Other questions of Mr. Chair?
All right. So is this a public hearing? Thirds action item. Action item. We changed the ordinance
to make it that correct. We had it last time. Got it. Thank you.
Mr. Chair, I just want to make sure. All right, this is back.
Mr. Chairman, before I make my motion, I'll give my lead into it. On September the 9th, we had
this before us. We had multiple members of the community come forth stating their agreement with
or discouragement of approval of the CUP. I asked the applicant if he would have a town hall
meeting which he graciously agreed to do. We held a town hall meeting on November the 13th at
this center. Many of the items that you see here this evening are, well, all of the items are a
direct result of the community input that was at that meeting, including the noise reduction
as is currently he has in excess of 70 decibels permitted under a festival permit. It would be reduced
to not greater than 50 decibels with this proposal. No subwoofers would also be allowed to be
utilized for the event. Another item that was of concern of mine is there were several items that
came forth and watching him perform his festival permits that were of concern regarding alcohol
and other items. I desired personally to see number six, which is the CUP shall be reviewed by
staff at the 1224 and 60-month anniversary dates for compliance. What this simply means is if
there are two or more validated violations that it has an expedited process for revocation,
it is simply put in place to protect the community. I therefore would like to make a motion
that we approve CUP number 08-20, however, I will not be supporting it.
All right, if heard the motion to approve is our second.
Anyone? Second?
The motion will die for lack of a second, sir.
Does anyone else care to make a motion concerning this application?
All right, we'll move forward.
Following we have a series of MDPs which are presented for information only.
If an MDP is judged by staff to meet the ordinance and the requirements thereof, it is approved.
Mr. Klein, thank you, sir. It's good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.
Chairman Dehaven laid out that these are MDPs and they are in a form that is administratively
approval. Staff is happy to answer any questions you may have on the first item which is
Stonewall for Industrial and we've also prepared a brief presentation should the board desire.
Thank you. All right. How would the board like to handle this one?
Would you like to have a presentation? We're ready to move on.
Everyone? Thank you, sir. Let's go to 0520.
This again, this is a master development plan that is in a form that is administratively
approval for the Fairfax Downs development. Staff is happy to answer any questions you may have
and we also have prepared a brief presentation should the board desire. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir. Questions of Mr. Klein? Supervisor Slotter.
I have one question for clarification purposes with regard to the roads in the development,
which you let us know or tell us whether they are public or private roads to the specifications of
VDOT. All of the roads in serving the development will be public roads constructed to a VDOT
standard that would be accepted into the state system. That includes the housing development at the
back of the proposed town center. That's me and that is correct. Thank you.
What else? Yes, sir. Supervisor Doug. On this housing development
from what I've read, there's the potential of significant congestion.
I don't know to say anything that VDOT can do to offset that. Is that correct?
I mean, that's a question. VDOT has reviewed the project as part of the master development plan
and when the project is ultimately designed through a subdivision design plan at a later date,
VDOT will also review and comment on the improvements. But those improvements would be consistent
with those that are shown on this master development plan. But for the 93 houses that are there,
everybody's going to use them in the morning. What happens? I mean, the current plan is not
addressed that I might go right or wrong. The intersection where the housing development would
enter on to South Warrior Drive. That has been reviewed by VDOT. We've had numerous discussions
over the last 10 months regarding that and the facility that is being shown on the master development
plan meets what VDOT would require for the number of units that are being proposed.
The last question is for proffers that have occurred in here, can you just review what those
proffers were? There are no proffers. This application was not part of any rezoning application.
It is a by-right development. Thank you. But while you're up, it's by-right because the developer
is using TDR credits. Yes, sir, that is correct. I think that's important because the TDR program
was put into place to help preserve rural atmospheres in our county that might turn into five
acre developments and so forth and so on. In this situation, it's kind of unique because we're
taking these TDRs on a commercial residential section. And while I'm not to happen and it eliminates
our opportunity to have any kind of money control over these houses going in,
we do, we will have some say as far as VDOT at the end as far as access and ingress, but other than
that, it's a done deal. Yes, sir. Mr. Wells, I appreciate that. So the VDOT issue I understand
the fact that we're going to have 93 more houses. There's a capital cost in the neighborhood of
$20,000 to $25,000 per house. It's something that, you know, as this community continues to grow,
we didn't have further expenses. So I've talked before about capital cost recovery and other
ways to address that issue. And that's Mr. Wells, my other concern on this. So we understand
that it is what it is, but I'm just recognizing we still have to address that other issue as well.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Other questions? Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir.
So to supervisor Dunn's point, what would have been the density of this buy-right had the TDR
has not been applied to this parcel? Properties are presently zoned R.A., rural areas. So they would have
a five or one unit per five acre density. So potentially there would only be ten, there's ten
dwelling units that could be constructed by right currently without the use of the transfer
development rights program. But with that, they're able to develop 93, 83 additional units for a
total of 93 units. But the trade-off then is that there are 40 some odd units that could have
been built in other places in the county that won't be built in the future, is that correct?
Correct. 83, sorry, 83, yes. Correct. Thank you.
We're looking discussion, anyone. Thank you. Let's move on.
DRC floodplain ordinance adjustment required by code for FEMA's new flood map.
Mr. Perkins, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.
On January 29th of 2021, Frederick County will be receiving adopted or updated flood insurance
rate maps from FEMA. So these flood insurance rate maps are the official maps for the county that
show our special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones. Now flood mapping is an important
part of the national flood insurance program as it is the basis of the flood insurance program
regulations and flood hazard insurance requirements. So flood insurance, I would note, is available
to property owners in Virginia under the NFIP, which is administered through FEMA.
Now with that, while communities, their participation in this program is voluntary
and if IP flood insurance policies are only available within localities that actively manage
floodplains by participating in the program. So when a community joins the program,
we as a community with our ordinance must make sure that we adhere to the floodplain
management and minimum requirements so that they meet those flood insurance program requirements.
So pretty much with that, if Frederick County's ordinance does not meet those minimum requirements,
FEMA does not offer flood insurance to our residents.
So with that, while we're here tonight, when flood insurance rate maps are updated,
community floodplain management ordinances are looked at by DCR and they need to be updated accordingly.
So the Virginia Department of Conservation Recreation DCR, they provide communities when
the maps are updated with a model DCR ordinance. That model ordinance contains the minimum
requirements necessary. So I would note that within there, there's a couple sections that are
in that model ordinance in your agenda that were highlighted in red. Those are suggestions that
DCR recommends for higher standards. But I'll go into that one next. So with that, we've updated
our floodplain ordinance to be consistent with those DCR model ordinance requirements to maintain a
consistent compliant ordinance. So there are a number of sections. I won't go through them all
that are being updated. A lot of it's just changing some words around, moving some stuff.
Probably one of the biggest significant changes is an addition of accessory structures within
floodplains. Now I noted previously with DCR's recommended higher standards. Now through discussions
with the DRC in the planning commission, there was one that has been consistently left in for
discussion tonight before the board of whether or not the board wants to see this one recommendation
left in. And this piece falls under the existing structures within floodplain areas for when you
have structures and uses that need to be brought into conformity when they're changed, repaired,
improved. So the one recommended DCR higher standard with those changes. It states that the change
went added to all changes made during a rolling five-year period. It does not constitute 50% of
the structure's value. So DCR is reasoning with that is that you would have a property owner that
could be splitting up improvements over a number of years that then exceed that 50%. Whereas now,
it's kind of a yearly thing. So really what's that said is that you would kind of monitor what
they would be doing within a five-year period to make sure that they're not doing substantial
improvements to a structure in a floodplain. The Development Review and Regulations Committee
discussed this at their November 23rd meeting, planning commission on December 2nd.
So as I stated, most of the year's requirements are mandated by DCR and FEMA requirements
with the exception of that one higher standard that we are seeking clarification of whether
the board wants to see that in or out. So tonight, this is presented for discussion. We are
seeking authorization to send this forward to public hearing. I would be glad to answer any questions.
Questions? One. So I do. So accessory structures or structures that are now in the floodplain
that weren't previously in the floodplain. You cannot improve those structures over time
and not violate the 50%? Right. With the 50%, Mr. Chair, he's the floodplain
administrator, so he might have to assist me with these. But when you have substantial improvements,
that's that 50% threshold. So if you're doing small minor repairs that aren't hitting that
threshold, then you don't have to do that bringing them into compliance. It's when you hit that
that 50%. That's when you have to bring things above the blade-based flood elevations or the
free boards if we have them. But it's you have something that it becomes a non-compliant structure
because it comes into the floodplain with a new map. It's a structure.
Pretty much it's non-conforming and it's pretty much but then when you want to do something
different to it, that's when it kicks into that substantial improvement.
It didn't help me. I'm sorry. Mr. Chair, and Mr. Chair, I might have to help me without.
So you were very clear. But take this example, several hundred thousand dollar investment
in a commercial ability. That you're one or two things. You're either going to have to bring
an into compliance which is impossible in most situations or you're going to slowly let it rot.
If you have an existing structure that then due to a flood rate map becomes in the floodplain where
it previously was not and you wanted to do improvements to it. Is that what you're asking
or what would happen? You would one of two things. You would either maintain it or let it sit
there and rot. And you could continue to maintain it unless there was some large storm event
then that you had to do a substantial improvement where in the definitions, you severe damage.
So that's the point when you're doing those improvements, if it's damaged severely,
then you'd have to bring it into conformance. If it was damaged severely by a storm
event. And so what choice do it? Correct. And that structure would then be covered under
flood insurance because it would be in the floodplain. So then improvements would then be part of
of that payout. As MacArthur, I have somewhat of a concern because I deal with this with
financing of real estate and a lot of lenders won't make a loan on real estate in a flood plain
unless it has flood insurance. So if we were to put something like that in there, I'm concerned
that we'd have a lot of folks who would find it impossible to finance or refinance property
to its full value because of the fact that the flood maps have been redrawn. So I'm concerned about
the practical implication of having that restriction in there. So from my question to you is
is the practical impact that if we include the recommended language that anyone who would make
a substantial improvement beyond the 50% value mark would no longer be qualifying for flood
insurance, including that accessory structure, is that correct? They would still qualify for
flood insurance. It's just a matter of keeping track of how much improvements that they're doing
during each cycle before they're kicked into substantial improvement and have to upgrade the
whole section. So if if if this were implemented in the county, you know, person, you know,
the homeowner applied for a permit to do upgrade to year one, that was 25%. And then, you know, year two
came in with, you know, incremental pieces. That's what that's trying to capture. And that's
completely up to the board whether or not you want that in or not. Forgive me, because I'm totally
lost. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what the practical impact of one versus the other is. I'm not
clear on that. So it's hard for me to make a decision not knowing what one if I can try and help.
Surely you're you're existing ordinance limits the amount of investment you can make
into a structure that's in the floodplain. You're capped at 50% of the value of the structure.
What this does is if I make a small improvement this year, that's not 50%. I can't come back next year
and make a substantial investment because they're going to count for five years. They're going to
total up whatever improvements you've done for five years. Now that five years is rolling.
But what it does is it keeps you from making incremental improvements that would eventually total
more than 50% within that five year rolling window. So eventually if you wait long enough,
you know, that initial improvement you made is going to drop out of the calculation.
Exactly. Yes, Mr. Chair.
So just to clarify, so in other words, and maybe you can help me, Mr. Attorney, so in other words,
or we're doing is we're saying, if someone who yesterday had made a substantial investment and
like supervisor, the Haven had mentioned a commercial building, and tomorrow it's in a flood zone,
they now can't maintain that structure without being in violation of the ordinance if they go
beyond the 50%. No, they would still be able to maintain their structure, you know, regular maintenance
and upkeep. This is just saying saying that I want to do a, you know, a drastic, you know,
improvement to the structure, you say, in addition or, you know, gutting it and increasing the value
by 50%. That's what is what this catches. It's not saying that you can't have standard maintenance
of a structure to keep it up. But it's an increase in value by 50% from the original value of the
structure or the existing value. Right, it's the value of the home that 50%.
It's not a matter of whether or not we'll allow or disallow it as a matter of the time frame
that we're looking at when the improvements are made, is that really what it boils down to?
Yes. Okay. So you can't hit, you can't hit that 50% within that rolling five-year period.
You looked like you had a comment, right? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think one of the issues is the
with the inclusion of that 50% limitation. It's likely that property in the county would be deemed
to be a lower underwriting risk. Without it, the insurers, even though they get a federal
subsidy for this program, are likely to deem the properties to be a higher underwriting risk,
which means higher rates. The insurance will still be available just at a higher rate.
Brothers are done. So my question is,
oh, okay, you're ready. So here, my question to you, based upon what you've said,
if I have a building, commercial residential, whatever, that is not in a floodplain today,
and they redraw the line so that I'm now in a floodplain, which I had no control over.
Exactly. Now, if I want to get insurance from my house, I have to feed certain qualifications
because I'm in a floodplain, and the floodplain determines how much insurance I cannot get, correct?
What would happen if you had a property that was yesterday not in a floodplain, and then
FEMA mandates these new maps. Congratulations, you're in a floodplain. Then you typically will
receive a notification that says you need to have flood insurance now, and then you have to go
and purchase flood insurance. Okay, so let me just walk through it. So I have a house
or a commercial building. I'm now eligible for flood insurance and the price will change because
I'm now in a floodplain. If I then want to go, as Mr. Hames said, and improve my property,
if I go from 100 square feet to 250 square feet or 149, I'm okay in five years.
And then if I can go that for another five years, one question I posed to you is in that type
of situation. Can you have the insurance for the existing structure? And if you add additional
items, that would not be covered. In other words, the risk will be borne by the owner of the property,
but it would be able to maintain the existing structure, which the day before Candice spoke,
was not in a floodplain. Today, it is in a floodplain through no fault of his own.
Dupel, under your entire structure would still be covered under your flood insurance?
Well, that's going to be between you and the insurance company as far as what you represent
to the insurance company is the value of the property, which is why, frankly, the advice to people
generally is always check your insurance to make sure you're properly insured for the right value,
especially during hot real estate markets. Because all of a sudden, you may not have enough
insurance to replace it. Let me say this because it may help. We have no choice here.
FEMA has upgraded the maps to a much higher resolution than we had in the past. They did it without
expense to our community. There were way more people who benefited by not having to buy flood
insurance now than previously. And there were some that were hurt. It's just the way it is.
Supervisor Graber. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just wanted to have a point of clarification here.
The one-year 50% requirement, as we presently have, are we required to go to the five-year
rolling, or can we stay at the one-year as I had understood? It's just at a higher rate, is that?
The five-year is just a suggested higher standard from DCR. We do not have to have that.
What's in the ordinance currently meets minimum. So that was just brought to the board to see
whether or not you wanted that or not. Thank you for the clarification. It would be my preference
to keep it at the one-year 50% requirement. While I understand there could be the possibility
of higher insurance premiums over the long run, it does allow our landowners and property
owners to make more changes. Should they deem necessary? I think it is in the best interest of
our property owners or for us to protect our property owners. So I thank you for bringing
that to our attention. You attend that as a motion, sir? Yes, I'll make that as a motion.
Thank you. Second? Yes, sir. In the second. Discussion, further discussion.
Anyone? Are we ready? Supervisor Stegmar. Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Slotter. Supervisor
Well. Supervisor Dun. Supervisor Graver. Chair votes aye and motion carries.
That will bring us to board liaison reports. Are there any? Hearing none. Citizen comments.
This is the portion of our meeting. We set aside for citizen comments on any issue that you might
like to bring to our attention. I'd ask you to come forward. Share your name,
magisterial district and limiter comments to three minutes or less, please. Welcome, sir.
I'm Loney. I create Mr. Gravers, my representative.
Five years ago, my wife and I moved up here, be close to our children and grandchildren,
and realizing that at our age, probably this would be where we would spend our last days.
We chose to move to the Cross Creek Village, which is a retirement community, and we did that
because there's no grass to cut, no snow to shovel, and no steps. So we thought we could stay in
the house probably longer. Maybe we could even beat the nursing home thing that's always
looming out there. We borrowed money, bought the house, borrowed more money to fix the house.
Five years later, we've got a renovation done. We're ready to enjoy the house.
Problem is, we've got a really noisy neighbor, and that's the trucks.
My manufacturing place down there. I begin to take 30 second
videos on my iPhone to get the date and the times of the noise, as was recommended to me by my HOA.
I've been doing that. I purchased a decibel meter, and I now have those included. Now,
I've given you the information there. You can look through all that stuff to try to keep this
brief because it's getting late. Here we are five years later. We've got this increased noise
from strex. They're running at about 64 to 68 decibels at my house.
At that level, normally in my house, the decibel level is 40, 40.1, 40.2.
Now, they've got a jacked up to 44 decibels. Now, I can't go any place. I can't get away from
that sound. Now, the people that run trex, they are on the other side of town. They never hear
the noise. The people that work there that make the noise, they go home. I live there. I can't get
away. March the 17 through the 21st around the clock, five consecutive days. I'm asking the board
to, in the future, when you make any of these, when you come across these things, I've given you
the thanks from the Center for Disease Control blogs that asked that recommend an outdoor
residential limit of 55 decibel to be healthy. I'm asking the board to, in the future, not allow
anything over 55 decibels. Right now, your Frederick County noise regulations
state that this is something that you're interested in, that you're interested in the health
and the welfare and the safety of the people who live here. And yet, and in that, you restrict them.
I'm sorry. That's fine. So, go ahead. You restrict them to 60 decibels. But a few hundred yards
down on your own, you're allowing an industry 80 decibels that rolls right up against my house.
My wife and I are five years older than we were, we've come up here. We're now too old,
too tired, and too poor to make another move. So, another thing, like I said, I would ask you,
in the future, you abide by the 50 decibel recommendation that comes from the CDC.
Also, I, at currently, Trex's under construction, they have two cranes down there. I would appeal to you
to ask to reach out to them and see if there isn't something, but while they've got in a construction
mode, something could be done to reduce this noise. I can't bear the thought. It makes me visibly
sick to my stomach to think of spending the rest of my life and not the rest of our lives
being tormented with this noise that we can't even get away from by going in the house.
And that's all I've got to say. Thank you. And one other thing, thank all of you. I appreciate
what you do. I can't do it. I wouldn't do it, but I appreciate that you do do it. So, no matter
what happens, you always have my respect. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I'm going to leave.
Anyone else that would like to share with the board? Stick around Mr. Muloney.
Please stay. Anyone? Yes, ma'am.
I'm actually impressed to Pino, if my husband spoke earlier. I don't know if this...
A Creek District. Yes. Thank you. It is a Backstreet District. On September 26, we came home from
vacation and all I heard was music. It sounded like someone was in my backyard with a truck,
having a party with their music turned up. We go in our house, we're loading all of our stuff
from our vacation and we can hear it in our house. Our windows aren't open because we just got home.
I live on Bushy Ridge Drive, which is not on the Stave Street that the event center is on.
So, I did not get a zoning notice. I tracked through the woods. I was so irritated.
I tracked through the woods and I'm sure I'm on a lot of hunting cameras because no trespassing
signs went up shortly afterwards. And then I heard a preacher, I heard the whole thing and I
thought, what in the world's going on? I couldn't figure it out. I don't know if there's a way
like when zoning comes up that not only the people on the street are notified, but the people
I live less than a mile across the road. I live right where the beautiful mountain is.
So, the music is hitting my house because that's where the barn was built with the structure
and the music. So, I was never informed. And when I found out that there was a meeting here today
with other residents, I had no idea. I wasn't in that meeting or I would have been able to
voice my concerns. So, I don't know if there's any way in the future to let other residents know
in a further, not just the neighbors because it affects everybody. Thank you.
Thank you. Anyone else? Anything they'd like to share with the board?
Last chance. We'll close the public comment portion of our meeting. Board of Supervisors comments,
are there any? Mr. Chairman. Supervisor Stegmar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
From the time of our last Board of Supervisors meeting, Governor Northam,
has declared his support for the legalization of the recreational use of marijuana.
A position that this Board has expressed opposition to as a part of our legislative packet
that has been sent to the General Assembly. Mr. Chairman, how can a self-professed pediatrician,
a children's doctor, do this, knowing that he is risking the health and well-being of many
Virginia adolescents? The Governor says he's taking this stand to take another step
and showing his remorse for dressing up as a black face or a Ku Klux Klan member at a party
and early in his medical career, about which he came close to resigning. Mr. Chairman,
how in God's name is this going to improve the lives of African-American kids or any
of Virginia's children for that matter? How is this justice for any young person?
The Governor's other rationale for supporting marijuana legalization is the extra money that will
flow into state coffers from those corporations involved in the marijuana industry.
Mr. Chairman, you and I and all the members of this Board of Supervisors know that no amount of
additional state government revenues would ever justify sacrificing the health and well-being
of our adolescents, here in Frederick County or anywhere else in the Commonwealth.
There are those pundits who are saying that because Democrats control both houses of the
General Assembly and the Governor's office, that there is nothing that can be done about this
proposal. Mr. Chairman, the only way to stop it is to organize a statewide organization of parents,
teachers, health professionals, law enforcement officers, clergy, family court judges,
politicians, and other community leaders to attempt to communicate our outrage about this to
the elected officials in Richmond. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr.
Loney, I'm empathetic to what you said. I had a mother who was dying of Ligareg's disease,
and for a year had nothing but noise coming from six o'clock in the morning to eight o'clock
at night, nine o'clock at night, seven days a week, it was holidays, et cetera. I know there's
a noise ordinance. I think that at least I owns one, maybe some others, maybe can reach out
to Trex and say, hey, you got to work with your neighbors. So I'm empathetic to your items.
We heard your words. We're not going to be able to take a vote on this or address that, but
you happen to live there, and I haven't said I'm being on the receiving end of constant noise.
I fully know what that's like. So perhaps the president of Trex can come and work with you
to try to work something out so that they're able to produce product, but you're able to sleep at night
and not hear them in the morning. I'm sorry, sir. We can't do this exchange.
I'll talk to you later, but I'm just making a comment to let you know that.
At your choice. If you leave, I'll call you if you want to stay.
Go to bed. Go to bed, and I'll call you. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
Are there comments, anyone? Mr. Chairman? Supervisor Graber? Mr.
Mr. McCaw, thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Graber. I'd like to follow up with Supervisor
Steck Myers comments. I'll join you in helping to organize such a resistance. I think it's important
to answer your question about how can a politician who was a pediatrician support and good
conscience and measure like this, the same way that it can support and fantasize. I think
is the answer to your question. I'd like to make a comment about something I heard in church
last night. There was a young man who was having a conversation with a teenager and they were
talking about how the government, and they use government in general, keeps talking about how
we're looking forward to a dark winter. And he said, how can it be? I'm going to tear up.
How can it be a dark winter when Jesus is coming and the Christchurch is going to be born?
And I want to tell that young man and everyone else in this county that this government
doesn't look at things the way that the other government does, that there is hope, that there
is a bright light coming, and that I hope every single one of you has a bright and merry Christmas.
Thank you, sir. Supervisor Grieber. It's a hard act to follow. Very well, we're very well said.
I simply wanted to follow up on Mr. Maloney's comments. Each of you got a packet this evening
that Mr. Maloney brought. I have met with him twice, and I've also asked Mr. Sharon to come out and
get some readings there on several occasions. I would encourage anyone who would like to follow
up with that to follow up with Mr. Sharon to see what his readings were, and some of the things
that he saw as he was out there walking the property. There's some additional information there
that I think might be helpful to all those who are making a decision. In light to other comments
that have been made regarding the proposed event center in our district, you will have some
peace and quiet for a year. The motion was shot down this evening. We do appreciate you coming
in speaking, however. While I do believe that a good faith effort was made by the Smiths to
notify folks, I know that they sent postcards out to many folks that were not direct neighbors.
How your road was picked or not picked, I can't speak for how that decision made, you know,
process was made. I do know that there was a good faith effort to try to get notification out
there and I apologize if you were missed. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Anyone else?
Are you sure me well? Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman. Before I adjourn, just on behalf of the board,
I wish everyone a very Merry Christmas. Good evening, this evening, be safe. God bless everyone.
Make the motion that we adjourn our meeting, Mr. Chairman. Sure, the motion and the second
discussion. All those in favor, aye. All right. We'll stand adjourned.
Thank everyone for their time and attention.
