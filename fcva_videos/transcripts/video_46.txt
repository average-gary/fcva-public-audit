production of the amount of real estate tax is being collected on a version

budgets and our neighbors and other counties are doing the same so I do think
it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to sort of hand ourselves in by
perplated money that very likely may not materialize during the next
fiscal year so I want to support this I support the tax rate I do not

a'r public hearing.
A'r public hearing is a little different
than it has been in the past.
And I will point out that indeed,
the number of citizens that take care of transition
to continue to be part of the public health service.
And they have been forwarded
to the Board of Supervisors available online.
I believe the last count was we had 62
before four o'clock this evening,
and of course we were preparing for this meeting.
I know the Board has all of those comments.
I know also that Mr Williams has provided some guidance
on alternative choices, if you will,
that the Board may have been dealing with this particular request.
Should not choose next term supported in this evening.
With that, Mr Chairman,
I'm available to answer any questions that the Board may have,
and we're going to do this a little bit differently.
The applicant, Mr Ty Lawson,
representing tower companies is here,
and he has a presentation,
brief presentation to make,
and we'll be doing so through the adjacent,
the adjacent office,
and I will assist moving through the applicant's slides
for that purpose.
Thank you, sir.
Questions of Mr. Ruddy?
Anyone?
Thank you.
Mr. Lawson will be here with us.
Can you hear us in the executive session room?
We'll be set up here in just a minute.
Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, can you hear me now?
Yes.
Thank you.
Now, speak with the Board.
All right.
You all hear me, OK?
Go up directly into the mic.
Sorry.
Mr. Chairman, can you hear me now?
Yes.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, members of the Board,
I'm Todd Lawson here on behalf of the applicant tower company.
I greatly appreciate the Board and staff putting this together
in these tough times.
As you all know, the conditional use permit for this tower
was filed back in November of last year.
The reason it was filed is because there's a need to improve service
in the area that is depicted on the slide.
The job I've seen before, and we're going to just show you
a few of them here tonight.
The service, of course, is telecommunications,
which is a utility service required for daily life,
which has become quite important recently.
Engineering work that was done in which confirms the need
for enhanced service was done, actually,
at the time prior to the filing.
And certainly before the current health crisis,
since that time, schools have been canceled.
Work is being performed online at home.
Churches are closed providing services online.
And much is the work of workforce is working for home.
And, of course, all social connecting is online.
Indeed, tonight's hearing is able to be made possible thanks
to Sal and Cable Service.
As the letter I sent you all, and hopefully,
is in the packet of April the second stage
at the time of the conditional use permit was filed,
Shantel was seeing and experiencing approximately every 18 months,
the amount of data demanded from its customers doubled.
That demand has dramatically increased as a result of the health crisis.
Appreciate and thank the significant amount of time
and coordination that has occurred with county staff
and the county attorney to put this hearing together.
And the information that has been provided to the board
and the public, as we all know,
there are federal regulations that apply to regulations
and applications as these, and they mandate timely hearings.
And hence, the hearing tonight, we have all staff,
county administration, this board and this applicant,
working diligently to satisfy this federal mandate.
The first slide, Mike, if you can.
Mr. Chairman, give me a moment.
I'm looking at him in hard form.
I'm hoping you're looking at a tower search overview.
Excellent.
Prior to this application, there were two other sites
that were tried through the public conditional use permit process
to install powers and serve the region
that the need of enhancements in a later slide
I'll show you a yellow circled area
that we're trying to provide service to,
better service to.
The first one was the
Berman Library, which was a Shantel effort.
And the site next to the BASS Hoover Elementary,
which was an application filed by Vertical Bridge for Verizon.
Both of these sites,
and the site that is currently before the board are designed
is co-location opportunities,
I just to say that, although the sponsor and immediate tenet
is one carrier, the tower is designed
and it is believed that this tower is allowed
to be installed.
Other providers will take advantage of the opportunity
and co-locate on the tower
and provide service to this region.
Issues arose with the other two sites,
Berman Library and BASS Hoover,
and the result, the conditional use permits
were not ever approved for those sites.
As a result of that and other searching,
we are not aware of any other viable sites
for the installation of a tower to serve this region,
other than the site that is currently before you.
And, of course, the demand remains
and, in fact, the demand that we were experiencing
when we filed has actually gone up.
The next slide, hopefully, says Proposed New Tower.
Thank you.
The site that is proposed is represented on this slide.
It's on land grant, lane LLC property,
which is private property and located south
of the Old Dominion Green subdivision north
of a portion of existing Chirando Park.
And, of course, the portion which lies north of Fairfax Pike.
It's actually surrounded by land that is owned by the park,
but has not yet been developed.
The next slide, Mike.
This shows the construction of the tower.
It's monopol, and it also shows the opportunities for co-location,
which is certainly a requirement of the ordinance
and something that we want to comply with.
We've had meetings and communications
with our neighbors.
Actually, we had a very well-attended meeting
at the Bowman Library.
Supervisor Wells was present,
and one of the planning commissioners, Roger Thomas,
was there as well.
The original proposal was for a 195-foot tower,
but after receiving comments and conducting
additional engineering, we're able to reduce the height
by 45 feet to what's before you
and what's being requested, which is a 150-foot tower.
The next slide, Mike, is an aerial
of the land grant lane LLC site.
Note that property is surrounded by board privacy fencing,
and a significant amount of mature vegetation,
and that internal to the property,
there's still additional areas that are fenced in
with board privacy fencing to serve as screening.
I have to point out, the photograph on slide,
this slide, does not accurately depict
the site in its current condition.
As part of the CUP application process,
and actually before November,
it took a couple of months,
but working with the county and the property,
an owner, the vehicles and other things that you see
and outside storage that was not allowed
per ordinance was actually removed
from the property and was a condition of the filing
of this application.
And in fact, as I said,
the application was delayed several months
until this occurred,
a current aerial of the property,
which show that if there is any storage there,
it's all in compliance with Frederick County ordinance,
ordinances, and stored behind privacy fencing
that is internal to the site.
Also, we depict on this slide additional trees
and as a part of the conditional use permit,
and in response to neighbor comments,
we've agreed to plant additional trees
on a portion of the park property,
which is outside the perimeter of the privacy fence
to fill in areas where vegetation
does not currently exist or is then, again,
the ideas to screen the private property,
the land-grant LLC property,
and improve the view shed from what currently exists.
The next slide is ground leveled,
and this is actually a view of the property
as you're driving into it.
You can see on the right the privacy board fence,
and it actually runs the length of the whole front
of the property, which would be viewed
from the Old Dominion Green subdivision as they look south.
Also, you see the existing trees,
or your equipment tour, and evergreen,
many of them, there's some deciduous on the right,
and that runs in various places along the fence line,
and, again, we're proposing to add a little bit more to that
so that there is additional screening
and the view shed is broken up a bit.
The next slide, thank you,
is the yellow circle that I talked about before.
That is the area, and you'll know that,
within the circle, you'll see some streets,
and now homes, it's hard to keep up,
but this whole area is building out quite rapidly,
and as you drive down those streets,
you'll see additional homes that have come in.
But this is an area that we're trying to desperately
to provide coverage for.
Shintel, throughout its network,
and Frederick County is no different,
has experienced additional demand,
what is depicted here,
and what it shows is the area
and what you're going to see in the yellow circle
and the community is located within it.
There's only service outdoors,
and not inside the residences with this tower,
we'll be able to enhance that service.
That's the next slide.
Red is bad.
And the red areas are,
and again, these slides are somewhat data.
Back before we filed,
so prior to November of 2019,
what we're experiencing is there is no indoor coverage
in the areas that are red,
there is in the grain,
and so what we're, again,
trying to do with this tower
is improve service within the yellow circle.
The next slide is green is good.
If the tower is built,
what this is going to do is greatly enhance service
within the yellow circle
and provide, as you can see in the areas
shaded in green, indoor coverage.
There still will be some areas of outdoor coverage,
but I'm sure you can appreciate the significant difference
and improvement if this is approved.
We have received, and there was a mention
by Mr. Roddy of the comments
that have been submitted from the residents online,
although we detected there was a cutoff,
and I'll speak at the end.
Someone was kind enough to send me a copy
of a comment and a screen
say, confirming that they had downloaded it to the county website,
it didn't show when I had left my office
to come to this meeting,
so I'll bring your attention to it.
But numerous comments,
they all seem to fall into general categories,
and I'd like to address them also.
I know that some individuals have commented more than once.
The first is the application is taking advantage
of the current health crisis
to move forward and prevent public comment.
Well, we've noticed that many comments have been delivered,
so that seems to be working,
although, again, it looks like there was a bit of a cutoff
in order to deliver them to you.
This CUP application was filed in November of 2019.
We've been working diligently with Frederick County
to satisfy the federal requirements for a timely hearing.
Additionally, the current health condition is created
and even stronger demands of the cell service,
which creates more of a need and urgency
for the approval of this tower.
Another common comment amongst those that have been submitted
is there seems to be some confusion about the height of the tower.
It was initially filed as 195 feet.
We heard people's comments about,
can't you do something to lower it?
We did, after going through the engineering,
what is before you as a request for 150-foot tall tower?
Nothing taller.
Another comment is that it seems that,
by several, is that another site or location
that is more rural ought to be found and used
for the installation of the tower.
And then coupled with that,
as the tower was rejected for Bowman Library and Bass Hoover sites,
why should it be allowed here?
This is to confirm that efforts have indeed been made
to find other sites without success.
If you scroll back at your leisure,
a couple of those slides,
you'll see the circle in the area in which we're trying to serve.
It's densely populated with commercial and residential
and there just are not sites available.
Land Grant Lane LLC property is quite unique
because it's privately owned,
does not have any restrictions on it
that would prevent the installation of a tower.
It is rural and it is in proximity
and able to serve the region that currently needs
and enhancements to its service.
Also, it's important to keep in mind as we have stated
in our letter of April the 2nd that the only other alternative
in terms of finding sites that are engineers
and being able to find is to go and resort
to the 50-foot towers that are allowed by right
to be installed in the right away.
Engineers have determined assuming those 50-foot towers
can be fairly evenly dispersed.
It would require approximately 15 towers,
50-foot towers,
in the residential and commercial right-aways,
within the yellow circle region to equate
this one tower would be able to serve.
Another comment and quite a few have made this,
tower will negatively impact residents' views
as well as those enjoying the park.
Land Grant Lane property is on private property.
It's not on the park and therefore it should not interfere
in any way with the use of the park
when the park property that is immediately adjacent
to the land Grant Lane is developed as a park.
The area currently, it's owned by the park,
the property around it.
The land Grant Lane site,
it is undeveloped and it's in a natural state.
There were actually some comments about that
and that it was not especially well kept up.
But again, it's in a natural state.
I also point out that especially in the evenings
when we were back in time when we were allowed to go out
and enjoy things,
if you were to drive through Old Dominion Greens
and you look to the south in the direction of land Grant Lane,
what you would see on the horizon are the lights
for the softball fields,
which are in the park.
They're on the property just north of Fairfax Pike.
And again, those lights are above the tree line
quite visible from your car.
I would feel certain that they'd be visible from the houses.
I have been informed that there will not be a requirement
to install a light on this 150 foot cell tower.
So visually what the residents from Old Dominion Greens
would see when they look to the south
would be what they are seeing now.
Another comment is property values will decline.
We've attached information,
learned articles that say just the opposite.
And again, in these trying times,
properties, I think it's common sense,
properties that do not have quality self-service
and internet connectivity are disadvantaged and devalued.
And then next, there are a few comments
about health concerns, risk of exposure.
One suggested that cell towers may somehow enhance
the coronavirus.
The Telecommunications Act has determined
that if a structure complies with FCC requirements
is disposited that there are no adverse environmental
or health effects, any user of this tower
would be in his subject to these federal regulations
and must comply.
And we are certainly agreeable as a condition to this CUP
that such compliance will be required
and will ensure that there are no health risks.
Finally, there are comments that some folks have another carrier
and they don't have any issues with this service.
The fact of the matter is that the data demand load is increasing
exponentially,
that all providers need to enhance their service
and their ability to serve their customers.
Note that one of the prior applications was one
that was advanced on behalf of another carrier
and they have not installed another tower.
So that need is still apparent.
This tower needs to be installed in order to maintain
and continue such quality service.
And finally, we do appreciate all the comments
that were made.
I do note that Mr. Williams sent a copy of a positive comment to me
just prior to me leaving the office
and it should be on the website
and we appreciate I've received other emails from folks
and support, recognizing that there's a great need
for this essential utility service that he is
and is more importantly a requirement of daily life.
I appreciate again the opportunity to appear and present
and be happy to answer any questions.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wilson, in light of some of the comments
that I have received in regard to this tower,
some of the concern was as well that we were able to present
their thoughts in writing they felt it would be most
appropriate to delay this for 30 or 60 days
so folks who come in and make comments and have interaction
is the applicant willing to delay a forwarding of this
as far as a vote up or down by 30 or 60 days.
Although the need for this tower is pressing and urgent,
I do understand the point and certainly this is awkward
and we do have authority if that would help
and alleviate that concern to table to a public hearing
with the hope and I know we all share this hope
as soon hearing or quick hearing where we can all get together
so that we can go forward with this tower.
So just so that I'm clear that is an affirmative
that the applicant would be willing to do that?
It is.
Thank you.
Mr. Wilson, anyone?
Laws from Supervisor Wells.
Weren't you offered that opportunity prior to this evening
and said no we're not interested in that?
We had changed.
I've been asked this question recently in advance of this hearing
prior to this we were asked about scheduling
and Mr. Wells were all in such a state of flux.
We don't know when this will be.
Each day hopefully we learn more information
and get a little more optimistic that we can get together again.
But yeah, previously, gosh, this is going back probably
certainly several weeks and maybe even longer than that ago.
With no understanding of when there may be a hearing
and what Mr. Graber, I've heard him just say was 30 to 60 days
but with no known date we were pressing
under the federal requirements for a hearing.
The reason I was asking that was I honestly don't believe
that it will be within 30 to 60 days.
It doesn't look like that's going to be happening in our world
right away.
That's just my personal opinion.
So I just wanted to bring that out.
But again, like I say, one of the things I made special
trips into the administrative building to find out.
One of my questions was just in fact has the clients
contacted about being willing to table this
and I was told that they had been offered that
and that they said no, they wanted to proceed.
So I'm ready to proceed.
Thank you.
Other questions of Mr. Lawson, anyone?
Mr. Graber, are you done?
Mr. Lawson, Mr. Blaine, done.
You made a comment about increasing coverage for the areas
and we've seen dozens of emails coming back.
I've asked and called people in that area.
They all seem to indicate that they are satisfied
with their coverage, including people from Verizon,
Centel, sorry, Sprint, N18T.
So can you elaborate on the reason that you're making the comment
that there is less coverage when existing people seem to indicate
that they have adequate coverage?
Number one, we are required as a regulated utility
to provide a certain quality of service
and our engineering determined,
and this is going back, Mr. Don, to last year.
And as the charge reflects it, there are many areas
within the yellow circuit circle where there is sell coverage
but it's only outside the home.
It is not inside the home.
And as a result of that,
and this actually dates back quite some time
when there was an effort to install a tower
under a conditional use permit at the Bowman Library.
This condition was known.
It was progressing, the demand,
as I pointed out,
is doubling from existing users every 18 months,
and that's a pretty steady pattern.
I've been advised by the engineers.
But the need is there,
and we are charged with keeping up with that
and satisfying that.
And we don't have, I don't have tonight,
an engineer to put in front of you,
but the demand has increased even more
as a result of what we've experienced
as a result of this health crisis.
Thank you.
For the questions, Mr. Lawson, anyone?
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Thank you all.
Lovely hearing.
That's the one I would encourage to speak to this issue.
Yes, sir.
I will note that you did receive previously
about 61 comments in writing,
folks who had wanted to be here.
We do have two that are signed up,
but the first gentleman who would like to speak this evening
is Kevin Seapley.
Thank you.
Come and speak.
Hello.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Welcome, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you in my glasses on here.
All right, everybody hear me?
Yes, sir.
All right, good evening and thank you for the opportunity to speak.
My name is Kevin Seapley and I live at 105M Record.
That is the house directly in front of the proposed cell tower.
I sent in a PowerPoint presentation to all of you.
I don't know if everybody had a chance to see it.
The reason why I did that is because I've heard Shantel's
presentation today, third time now.
And their pictures aren't as clear as what I put.
They've taken pictures from outside the neighborhood
and all my pictures show from my house,
inside my house or around my house.
No, they're not professional.
I just had my camera and Microsoft paint.
But they were just to give you an understanding of what I'm going to see every day.
You've seen the pictures, so I'm not going to rely on those.
I'm going to go with other points.
So it's going to be an eye sore.
Everybody knows that it's this big monstrosity.
It's going to be not even one football filled away from my house.
I have two little girls, wife.
We don't have a deck on the back of the house yet,
but when I do, that's what I'm going to look at day in and day out.
When I play with the girls, it's going to be there.
When people come over to the house for gatherings,
when that time comes again, that's going to be the topic of conversation.
Mr. Lawson said that home values won't decrease.
I've Googled numerous sites and other people in other areas
show that their housing went down because of the cell tower.
Shantelle slides have shown you areas in red,
showing how poor it is.
And then when they put the cell tower up, it's going to be green.
But what they're telling you is their network.
They're not showing AT&T.
They're not showing Verizon's and other carriers.
That is how poor their network is.
And the inside, the outside of the house,
I don't understand because if everybody had cell phones,
I'd be seeing them out in my neighborhood standing outside talking.
They're inside their house with talking on their cell phones.
So I don't understand that point to he made.
We paid for a premium lot to back up to the park with trees
and an open view of the mountains and so on and so forth.
But with this big structure, it's going to obstruct that view.
Yes, the lights are from the softball fields we see,
but they're in a distance.
They're not so close to the house.
We bought a house on a court so my girls can play.
Not so much traffic in previous meetings.
Shantel said that there will only be one extra truck a month.
So that's 12 trucks.
What they're not telling you is that there's four carriers leasing that.
That's times by four.
So now there's 48.
Let's round it up and say 50 trucks now.
So that's more traffic throughout the neighborhood.
Not including the landscaping business
that's going on back and forth.
And my last comment would be that the property owner,
he rents that.
So he doesn't see this every day.
He rents it.
He goes to and from business and he leaves,
whereas I'm going to see that every day.
So I leave that up to you guys on your vote there,
but I really appreciate taking the time and listening to hear me out.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate your comments.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Court, Maddox.
Welcome, Mr Maddox.
Thank you for having me and thank you for being here.
I believe I'm on a timer.
So I'm going to try to keep this short.
I submitted my comments one of the 62.
Of which all were against.
I wanted to make a couple of additional comments.
You know, for one, I know that Mr. Lawson has referenced the fact
that there will be more coverage.
And especially now during this time of the pandemic.
To me, it's quite frustrating and the fact that the infrastructure is already there.
We already have Internet via cable and FIOs.
So this tower isn't going to add any additional resources
for any of the neighboring communities.
So to utilize the pandemic for that, it's completely unacceptable.
But I also wanted to point out the fact that the last time this was proposed,
which was over by Bowman Library Supervisor De Haven,
made the motion to decline it based on the fact that it was surrounded by RP,
residential performing property.
If you look at their original slide, that was where the proposed
or where the previously proposed towers were.
You'll notice that there is far less space between that proposed or those proposed towers
as there is to all Dominion Greens with this proposed tower.
So there are other green spaces that could be utilized,
whether it be way back behind Wakeland Manor subdivision or up White Oak Road.
But there are other spaces.
But I think that I'll allow the other community members to speak for themselves
and the fact that you had 62 just in that one forum.
And I believe that a lot of other ones may have emailed you all individually.
So for that, we apologize for flooding your inbox.
We know that you have a lot of emails coming in about the pandemic.
And this isn't necessarily something that we wanted to address with you now.
But since Shantelle has proposed it, we're happy to oblige and be here and support against this tower.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
If I could, I did not make that motion.
I believe that Supervisor Wells did.
So the Bowman Library, that would have been a supervisor.
That would have been Fisher, yes.
That was me.
Yes.
Through the motion.
No.
Thanks again for sharing your conversation.
Thank you.
There's one else.
All right.
So we'll close the public hearing portion.
I believe this is effective.
And I've worked diligently on this with the residents that live there
and all the residents in the open district.
I go back just a short period of time ago,
when this came before our planning commission and was voted alone to one against the request,
the only change has been the height of the tower,
the other conditions that Mr. Lawson was talking about,
where improved performance for the residents.
It really doesn't have an effect on those particular areas on that side of 81.
And even in discussions way back when Chintel even said one of our main concerns
or one of our main target areas,
and this is the perfect spot for it to be,
is accessibility for Chintel users up and down the 81 corridor.
And I think that's still probably his part and most of the reasons for placement of the tower where it is.
As you know, it's been said that you got 60-some emails and majority of those are certainly negative.
And those folks didn't have to be here tonight,
but they had been calling me, they had been meeting with me as best they could throughout this situation.
So based on that, I would move to deny the conditional use permit number 0, 8-19
to construct a commercial telecommunications facility consisting of
a hundred and fifty-foot monopole telecommunications facility on a separate structure,
located at 107 Henry Court,
and has identified with property identification number 75-A,
dash 118 in the Opecumad which is...
Ocean to deny is our second.
Second, Mr. Chintel.
And the second.
Discussion, is there any?
Mr. Chintel.
Supervisor Graeme.
I would concur with the thought process if this is probably not the correct location to put this tower.
However, the applicant has applied it to other locations which were likely much better suited for the tower,
one being the Bowman Library.
I've been told by many folks in my district and other districts,
it's very clear that we know what the board doesn't want,
but it's becoming increasingly difficult to know what the board does want,
being we know what the board says they want,
which is increased broadband capability and other things as far as internet access and improved services.
But there was a study down, I believe it was in 2013, a broadband study,
that has kind of been shelved.
So, I think that if we're going to continue to deny companies the ability to put up a tower
to enhance the networks here in the county,
that we need to at least go back and look at the broadband study and set up a workgroup or committee
to work in implementing some ways to increase coverage in our county.
So, I'm a little disappointed in what I'm seeing.
I had well over 300 folks reach out to me, call me, email me when we were putting the towers up
and saying the 100-foot tower conversation back on February 11th.
And I had a lot of folks say we want towers, but it is starting to become apparent that folks say we want towers,
but it's just not in my backyard and that's concerning to me.
So, I think that the way that we get around some of this is to look at that broadband study,
get a workgroup together, and move forward on a way that can work for everyone.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir. Further discussion of the most.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As you know, I'm a proponent of providing excellent telecommunications coverage to our citizens,
and I've heard the argument made that this U.P. request is somehow akin to the request
that the citizens of Gaines were on back creek make desiring internet access in our rural areas,
but I would point out that there's a major difference between the two.
The towers requested by the citizens and Gaines were on back creek,
or just that, towers requested by the citizens.
In this case, I haven't seen any comments from citizens stating that they have no cell coverage
or that they need this tower in order to improve their cell coverage.
I spoke with Mr. Wilson yesterday and brought this to his attention,
and told him the fact was that I hadn't seen any citizens yet come forward stating that they needed this tower.
I've seen a couple residents of the county state that the towers should be built,
but none of them stated that they are current customers needing better service or citizens without service.
So I'm in favor of allowing towers to provide services that may be desired or needed by citizens.
I'm not inclined to vote in favor of the CUP's All Support Supervisor Wells' motion.
I also concur with Supervisor Graver that we need to do a better job on the planning side to identify solutions
to the telecommunications desert that we have in our county.
There's far too many people without access to telecommunications.
It's just in this case, I think there's plenty of people within the All Circle who have access.
Just maybe their access is through different providers.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Any discussion? Any comment?
Hearing none.
Motion to deny. Supervisor Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry, Mr. Wade.
This motion requires, as you can expect, to be sustainable,
and a federal and state law, a written statement of the board's reasons for denial.
The board has received a later this afternoon, and has a fantastic today's copies of that statement of denial.
So I would ask the records clear that the motion to deny is a motion to adopt that statement of denial.
There's well.
We haven't heard this evening's presentation and public hearing comments.
I would note three possible changes to that.
One is the addition of the PowerPoint presentation from Mr. Cipley,
is one of the attachments to it that incorporates that as part of the record.
Also, there's a paragraph in the document that has two blanks in it,
because we did not know who was coming tonight.
It's on the fourth page in the middle.
It says, whereas, and I'll read it with the numbers filled in,
whereas at the board of supervisors, public hearing on the application,
two citizens spoke against the proposed commercial telecommunications facility,
and none spoke in favor of the proposed commercial telecommunications facility,
and then also one of the telecommunications tonight is a complete record
that other suitable locations within the search area,
or other locations within the search area would be appropriate,
and we can add according language to it to include that provision.
And if that is acceptable to the board as the motion, I would see that.
The second motion is the motion.
That was the exception.
Second concurrence.
Any further discussion?
The resolution is in front of you with the amendments that Mr. Williams just spoke of.
Ready.
Supervisor Fisher.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Sir.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Dun.
Supervisor Gray.
Chair votes aye.
The motion carries.
It is unanimous to deny and adopt the resolution as a.
Thank you very much.
Bring us to 12 a planning commission business.
I believe that was you, Mr. McCarthy.
On March 11, 2020, our board voted to deny the rezoning number 06-19 Winchester Medical Centers revised proffers,
as one of the supervisors who voted the majority to deny the revised proffers,
I would like to make a motion to rescind our vote on that matter and bring it back before our board to reconsider.
I have spoken with board members of Winchester Medical Center that have indicated they are willing to revise the proffers further
to include the specific language originally written on the development plans,
as well as include language in the written proffers regarding access being granted to the neighbors to botanical drive.
Right, sir.
You've heard the motion.
Is there a second?
I will second that, Chair.
It was second.
Is there a discussion?
Supervisor Dun.
Supervisor McCarthy.
In the items that you said, what I heard you say was that they were right in the proffer,
as well as to confirm what was in the 2004 plan.
Is that correct?
That is correct.
I have to comment here.
I think that this is the wrong thing to do if they want to offer something new indifferent.
Let's see it.
Before we approve a motion to reset.
For further discussion, anyone?
I didn't make any comments on that, but I certainly felt the same way.
You did.
I really appreciate what Mr. McCarthy has done to get that.
And I don't think it would be a big deal to get that invited.
And that would make it official as far as I can.
I'd be a lot more comfortable with that.
Oh, man.
Supervisor Dun.
Mr. McCarthy.
If you want to consider to withdraw that motion, here's why the question becomes that if there's a change in its significant keyword significant under normal procedures that would go to Mr. Ruddy.
Mr. Ruddy then said, this is significant.
I personally think that it is.
It brings it back into my view.
In my view, what was played out in 2004, then Mr. Ruddy can bring that to the board and say, this is what has been changed.
Here's why it's significant to go from there.
So as a venue, that's something that was the thought crosses.
I wouldn't be opposed.
Mr. Dun to postponing a vote on this matter until we get something and writing from Winchester Medical Center.
I do want to add the on the record, though, saying that I think we're making a step in the right direction.
I'm talking directly with some of their board members versus with their attorney seems to have borne some fruit.
So I do want to be on the record saying that we're willing to work with them to encourage them to continue down this road.
I do think ultimately them being able to develop their property and their neighbors being able to develop their property and concert is a good thing for the county overall economically.
So I would be willing to vote in favor of a motion that would be made to postpone a vote on a rescinding until we see the actual writing.
Mr. Williams, that doesn't sound like we can make that.
Yes, supervise the fish.
I just same deal with this thing.
It's been a little bit confusing and everything.
I've been a little bit involved at Tuffel's Supervisor McCarthy on this.
This is the exact statement that was on the left to develop the plan, which is part of the proper.
They're willing to put that on the proper statement, the exact wording.
I think it's just kind of cut and dry.
I will take valley health at their word that they will do it.
I've seen the modified drawing, which was the original drawing.
I think we ought to move on with this and be done with it and get them back in here and move forward.
I would support Mr. McCarthy's motion.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Williams.
Just for clarity so that the board is with clear direction here.
If the motion is approved, it's a motion to rescind the previous denial.
It does not, in fact, then grant the requested proper petition amendment.
The board would still have to do that.
The board would want to do that at a future meeting date as one of the board members is suggested to have staff review it.
I want to make sure the board is clear on that understanding of if the motion is granted what happens that the board is not actually approving the change tonight.
It's just taking a step back and bringing it back to where it was in March 11th and no more.
And are there any time constraints on that motion to rescind it?
It really should be done sooner than later.
At some point, the period, typically the period within which a party can appeal.
And not the denial decision.
Decision on a land use matter is 30 days.
That 30 days is, in fact, up this Friday.
Now, I will say this in light of the current pandemic.
The Supreme Court of Virginia has entered now two orders that essentially extend all deadlines.
So it may well be that that time has been extended further.
But if the board is so inclined to consider this matter further, it probably would be best if the board got it back on its agenda to be done.
And as well, we'll remember that earlier this meeting, the board canceled its April 22nd meeting.
And with everything that's going on in the world, you know, we don't really know for sure.
Absolutely.
We're not going to be here.
So that at which time, then, Mr. McCarthy's motion to rescind the actual motion to rescind would be able to be heard.
Well, that changes things for me.
We need to go back to the March point.
I'm okay with that.
I don't think we should play with the ill-defined deadline or cutoff.
Not being able to predict it.
All right, further discussion, the motion and the second is to send.
The supervisor does.
Williams.
My question.
My question.
Miss Williams.
All right.
Sorry.
Okay. Fine.
We're going to question to you is that if we vote to rescind.
And then the the applicant comes back.
And if the applicant then we have them.
What was that in March?
And Mr. McCarthy has said that there was new language that was going to be there.
Therefore, if we had to vote again after that rescission, we would then have...
We would be voting on new language that we presented to us beforehand in writing that we binding to all parties if we accepted this act.
That's correct.
Again, this would basically just be a reset to where the board was on March 11, except that presumably the applicant is bringing something somewhat different.
Then it did when it was last before the board on March 11.
So therefore we would be voting on a different.
Proper.
This would be offered by the applicant.
Potential.
Potential act.
Yeah.
It depends on what they give us.
That was a group.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This is a question for our attorney as well.
It is my understanding of Robert Fools that when someone is entering a rescission like to rescind this and enter into the minutes.
It does not need a board vote.
It simply needs a second to be carried to the next regular scheduled meeting.
And since we canceled the second meeting for April, it is my understanding of Robert Fools that this would then automatically be put up on the next meeting which would be in May.
And my question then lies once we get that answered.
Does that give staff enough time?
And where do we stand?
And then lastly, is this not a continuation of the wording that was already there?
It was simply whether they were going to honor the wording that was in place.
So I don't see it being a major.
Inclusion to what is being considered here.
It was on the.
It was on the original documents.
There was no.
Consideration or discussion given whether they would or would not honor it.
And that's in my opinion, ultimately, we'll tell it.
Therefore, it's just a affirmation that they would honor what was on the 2004 2008.
I think that in terms of the procedure, I would say the outset that Robert's rules of order does not neatly cover the concept of rescission.
But as best as I have been able to piece it together and figure it out, a motion to rescind is still a motion that requires an action.
There's two distinctions there is that if the motion is without previous notice to the body, the motion would require either a two thirds vote of the body or a majority of the full membership of the body.
And from having read up on it, it seems that what it's the Roberts is saying is it has that after clause in there to ensure the rights of a potentially absent member.
At the meeting tonight, we have the third body figure.
So all the lessons all members rights are protected.
So the motion, I believe the motion is properly in order and that for it to carry with all members present, it would require four votes.
And I know the issue has been not entirely clear, but is best as I've read through it, that's the way I'm seeing it.
And on your second question, I think that depends on what the applicant were to give us.
If I understand what's happening here is what they're saying that they would do is both restore the language that was on the attached generalized development plan and make a change to the proper text itself.
But again, I've not seen it.
It is the procedure we've been following for some time.
If it helps.
Further discussion, anyone?
The motion is to rescind.
Supervisor Fisher.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Supervisor slaughter.
Supervisor well.
Supervisor time.
Supervisor great.
Chair votes aye.
The motion is unanimously passed.
And we send that act.
Right.
Or these on reports are the ring.
Hearing none.
We're the supervisor's comments.
You all would permit me to privilege.
I had a couple.
One is that we wanted to recognize the National Telecommunications Week, which we had discussed before.
February 16, 1968 was a monumentous day for public safety.
It marked the first time a 911 call was ever made.
We had five decades since emergency communication centers and their dedicated teams of public communicators have become the first touch point for emergency response.
Telecommunicators are the first voice that we hear when we call for help in our life-saving heroes.
Next week marks National Security Telecommunications Week.
We're going to recognize and acknowledge those people who dedicate their lives to answering our calls on what may be our toughest day.
We recognize and acknowledge the work that they do every day to protect our community.
They provide critical assistance during a person's worst time providing the calm reassurance they need to handle any situation.
The dedication is in measureable.
Their commitment on wavering and we thank you.
Following on that one, I would just like to share with you the way our staff has responded to all the issues that we are now dealing with.
The staff has gone above and beyond every day anything that could reasonably be special to them and have performed outstandingly and continue to.
We would ask it tickly that you continue to remember those frontline folks who are the first responders and the medical personnel that are rendering care.
We'd ask you to remember them.
Thank them when you have the opportunity and please remember them in your prayers.
I appreciate it perfectly.
Other supervisors comment anyone.
Supervisor Dunn.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
I'd like to reiterate a couple of comments.
One is on fire and rescue.
The discussion is good.
One call to the fire.
For example, the bingo operation is around hill.
It's costing around hill.
$4,000 a week.
That's significant.
It's also costing $10,000 for the golf tournament.
I know that in Greenwood, the pancake day has been canceled.
That's a fun race now.
So for those in this community, recognize that there are boys to raise money.
It's been spirally diminished and ready to make that be helpful.
The second item is the Situant House.
Mr. Grieber said earlier,
the next 24 to 36 months we're meant to go and we do a 9-1-1
extra generation tower system for our personnel.
The golf process is to see if we can go and co-locate one of those towers.
It's meant to be only 8-12.
The internet and cell service that requires investment in the county.
The towers are meant to go and have about 95% coverage in the county.
If those towers can go and provide that same service for everybody else in the county,
we don't have to have to scroll six to the towers to get the remaining 5%.
The conversation I went into the winter bird who said that the current situation
has been trying for 9-1-1, not for co-location.
So as chairman, you know, lead up here that you can go and put those two together.
Perhaps that's a way to address the broader issue of coverage in the county.
I don't know how to have a zillion-one towers, though,
but we're already putting 9-1-1 towers and we've used this separately
for the spring and six-day service.
So we're just going to have to go to our point of view.
We're just going to see if we can address the integration.
I'm not opposed to it, but the RFP does not address it.
The towers have to be designed through loads of engineering
and other technical issues.
So I'm not opposed to that thought process.
I'm not opposed to that, but we have an RFP on the street,
the value here, and the things back there.
And move from there.
If we can do something together.
I can do that.
This is the pay for it.
It's the other side of the question.
I was just proposing something, and the questions are good.
The questions are good.
That's what we can address.
It is.
There's Mr. Graywoods that put it out there and we can talk about it.
I am supportive of that discussion.
Thank you.
Others?
Anyone?
Mr. Graywoods?
Mr. Graywoods.
I think Mr. McCarthy bozed in first, and I'll let him.
If that's okay enough.
It's fine with me.
I'll raise my car.
Thank you, Mr. Graywoods.
And let it affect that our next meeting has been canceled for April.
Normally, I would be at this time of the year encouraging everyone to go out
and celebrate Apple Blossom, which is probably the pinnacle of our community pride each year.
Unfortunately, with the pandemic, it's affected just about everything,
including the Apple Blossom Festival this year.
Most of the festival has been canceled.
Horses of it hopefully will still occur later in the year, but that doesn't mean that we can't
still take pride in our community and celebrate Apple Blossom,
while social distancing.
So I would just encourage all those folks in the area that have their pinking green to hang it out
that first weekend in May and show some solidarity and find a good reason to get outside and enjoy
the beautiful weather and maybe drive through some Apple orchards but keep your distance
until the governor says otherwise, but I just want to encourage everyone to remember
who we are as a community and what we're proud of and what we can celebrate together.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
That was a great one.
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
I'd like to follow up a little bit on what Supervisor Dunn stated with the regarding the towers.
I believe that we are at a very unique point in our county regarding our towers.
I agree with Mr. Dunn that we should look at the co-location factors
to cost-affiliated with such and any of the co-ordinates that might be seen by leasing out towers
based on how we celebrate it and maybe cost beneficial to the residents.
And also we have benefit to our citizens and having additional internet or other access
that we have in addition by doing so as Mr. Supervisor Dunn has indicated
you may significantly reduce your number of towers in the amount of time that staff dedicates
to the CUP process or simply permitting processes for towers.
That was my first point.
Second point is this.
I want to thank my neighbors and other folks who have been together during this time of trial.
I know many who have given the food banks as of I.
I know others who have given to the fire departments and other things
due to their fundraising efforts being hampered.
I have greatly appreciated the togetherness even though we've had to be quarantined.
And I would encourage folks who have some additional funds or resources
and have the ability to give to food banks or give to your fire departments or those
on the first line to continue to do so.
And I thank you for the kind words and the efforts that I've seen at least in my district
and I could put forward to this effort.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Comments?
I would just thank you all for your participation.
I ask you to continue looking after each other.
Vice-Chairman Wells.
And I would move to the lead adjourn.
Most to adjourn, is there a second?
I can stand adjourn.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
