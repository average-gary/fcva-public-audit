A noture Steven City monthly average gallons per day of the sanitary flow for December was 320,212 gallons which exceeds the town's wastewater capacity limitation of 250,000 gallons per day.
3.503 milion gallons per day of the sanitary flow were required that the town not issue any new wastewater connections until 12 months.
Mr. Chairman that concludes my report.
Thank you sir. Appreciate that.
The next one on our list is Winchester Planning. We have no transportation and so I'll do Mr. Planting, I'll fill in for Mr. Mark Loring from the City.
The City had a public session on June, January 19, 2021. The election of officers for 2021 was chairman, it was Mark Loring, vice chairman, chairwoman, excuse me, is Lacey Burnett.
The second item they was motion to initiate an ordinance repealing a replacing article 17 of the zoning ordinance of City of Winchester. Virginia this amendment updates and improves regulations regarding non conformities in the Winchester zoning ordinance and it was initiated.
The third item was a corridor enhancement review of an eight unit townhouse development at 811 South Cameron Street that also was initiated so that concludes their report. They cannot be with us tonight.
And the last one on my report Mr. Graber do you have a report from the Board of Superbots?
I don't have any report but I did want to pass along to Mr. Ruddy as I believe this will be his last meeting maybe. I've greatly appreciated the opportunity to work with him and his professionalism and the kind things that he has done for our community members along the way.
He will be missed and he has been greatly appreciated.
With my opportunity to work with him and this board so thank you Mr. Ruddy for all the things that you've done.
Thank you sir. I will do a quick housekeeping back on committee assignments. I've got to kind of skipped over that. We do have some new members I need to bring on.
I will be signing her to the development review and regulations committee as well she'll be appointed to put Miss Catherine slaughter she'll be as been appointed to the comp plan committee CPPC and I'll also be removing John light off of the comp plan committee and all other assignments will stay the same.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
This is an addition to the let me see if I can get the slide the work here.
This is an addition to the green's spring agricultural horseland district and this is to add on 90.86 acres to that district.

The district is currently located along Glaes orchard road in south of the green springs road to the east. This request is to increase the district to 476.49 acres.
What happened Mr. Chairman is as you know we had our ag and forest little districts were updated a couple months ago.
We had the application received from you tonight where applicants who didn't get their applications in on time and actually fell through the cracks.
This is just to add on as you well aware we do sometimes get additional through the cycle five or cycle we'll get some folks to ask for additional acres to be in the district or be included in the district.
We're going to turn your attention to the map on your left and circle it on the lower right there. That is along the green springs district and again this is just an addition there's no change that we're going to increase the district.
The agricultural district advisory committee or eight act unanimously I recommend the approval of the 90 point 86 acres to the 2020 25 greens brings agricultural forest district after meeting they held at December 15 2020.
Again this is a request is presented public hearing and staff is seeking a recommendation for the planning commission to the board of supervisors on this addition to the green springs agricultural forest district.
Mr. Chairman asking questions do you any board members may have on this addition to the green spring agricultural forest district.
Thank you Mr. Chair and any questions Mr. Chair.
I see no one.
I'll make a motion.
I like your enthusiasm.
This time as the public hearing item I will open the public hearing day by but I'd like to come forward to speak to four against this item so the public hearing is open.
I see no one I'll close the public hearing and now we're going to be Mr. Tripplet this is Gainesburg district.

it is intended for use a capital planning facility document
not for requesting funding allocations.
Once adopted, the project priorities and cost estimates
are subject to change throughout the year based on different circumstances.
It's also possible the particular projects may not be funded during the year's shown,
indicated in the CIP, and it could be bumped to a following year with the next CIP
or completely removed.

$316,000,000 was last year this year is a $339,000 but we do have a drop in projects from the 82 last year down to 54 this year.
And then again you do have transportation in the airport. There's a series of maps that also correspond to these tables and the projects.
First you do have the general CIP map, which is the general government expenditures.
You have the school map, you have parks and recreation, and then you have the transportation priorities.
Well history of where this has been, the comprehensive plans and programs committee discussed this at their January 11 meeting.
The committee did determine that CIP is in conformance with the 2035 comprehensive plan, then they did send it forward to the planning commission for discussion.
So tonight we are seeking a recommendation from the commission on the CIP as well as affirmation that the 2021, 2026 CIP is in conformance with the 2035 comprehensive plan.
So with that I would be glad to answer any questions you may have, and I do believe we have some representatives in the audience as well.
Questions from Ms. Burkins.
Mr. Chairman.
Yep. But how much does the county spend every year on capital improvements for items that were on capital improvements plan that was approved 30 years ago?
That I couldn't tell you. Unfortunately I don't, I don't have the figure of what was on last year CIP or that was actually funded during the last budget cycle.
But I would be glad to send you that as a follow up if you'd like.
Where is the.
Certainly the county's not going to fund 300 plus million dollars with capital improvements.
Where do they come up with the plan of actually what's going to be funded and built?
And that comes through these are the priorities for each of the agencies within the county.
It's kind of just a five year list of things that they would like to see happen and they do rank them and then there's different allocations based on each fiscal year of what they would theoretically if those projects were to come before the board during a budget cycle.
Really, they just come from the rankings of what the agencies want to see in a perfect world.
And they're really necessary to be included in the CIP as part of the conference of plan just when dealing with rezoning and the models and how rezoning applications will compare with their impacts.
The questions.
Again, this is just a function of our make sure we conform to our comp plan.
And so this is a requirement code of Virginia.
So thank you, Ms. Perkins. Any other discussion?
Mr. Oates, last bullet seeking recommendation. Do we need to make a motion about that?
Yes, we need a recommendation to the planning commission or affirmation that the CIPs and conforms with the conference a plan.
2021, 2026, comprehensive plan is in conformance with our comprehensive plan.
Second, we need a roll vote or can we do a majority vote?
All those in favor of our motion presented? Say aye.
Aye.
Any opposed?
Motion will go to the board of supervisors also on our February 10th docket, the capital improvement plan.
We're always down to that famous other part of our meeting.
And I think tonight we have.
I don't think we have a meeting scheduled for our February 3rd.
It's seen a firm no from the Mr. Ruddy.
It gives me a moment then to think.
Recognize Mr. Ruddy for his service to us.
To what he has did to help me along personally, but also to his service to Frederick County and the planning commission and the planning department.
Thank you.
And Godspeed and your future endeavors.
And it has been a pleasure working with you.
And good luck to you and your families.
So thank you so very much.
Thank you, sir.
And with that.
Al Mr. Morrison.
I need a buzzer.
Yes, I'm sorry.
It's up far away.
Question came up last year late on the Steven City project where they utilized TDRs.
And then two weeks ago in the Winchester Star, there was a very nice opinion article in there that I felt very supportive of the gentleman's article.
When the TBRs came up several years ago, I can see great benefits to them, but I can see abuses in them.
And I think we saw pretty much all of the one and none of the other and this one that we did last year.
Everything was done legally.
It was done by the book.
It was perfect.
We had no input to it.
And I would really like us possibly with this newer information history to possibly do a review on our TDR regulation to see if we can tweak this a little bit.
Sir, I agree 100%.
We've already had those discussions in the month of December.
And it'll be one of our another bullet items we'll be discussing this year and try to work through and see where it can be approved of.
And what we can tweak it and see where we're at.
So yes, sir, I agree with you and it will be working on that.
Thank you, sir.
If no one has anything else, anything else to add to the calls?
There's our good friend Jim Wilmot would say.
I'll seek a motion for adjournment.
No move.
Can I have a second?
All those in favor?
Aye.
We're adjourned.
