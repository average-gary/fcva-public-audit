Vazor Slaughter.
Aye.
Vazor McCarthy.
Chair votes aye.
Emotion carries.
We'll forward to public hearing.
Mr. Chairman, that concludes my report.
Thank you, ma'am.
All right.
That will bring us to a public hearing or a festival permit request of Waveland Farm
LLC.
Who is this?
I've got it, Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
The security.
This is a request for Waveland Farm to hold at this point three events on the property
of Waveland Farm on Marble Road and Back Creek Med Steal District.
The three dates being requested are September 28th from 11 a.m. to 1030 p.m., October 5th,
again from 11 to 1030 p.m., and then October 19th for the same time frame 11 a.m. to 1030
p.m.
Staff's had some inquiries from board members, so I think it's probably pertinent for
me to try and bring everybody up to speed.
This property, as most of you will recall, came in for a special event designation as
a conditionally use permit.
There was a fair amount of discussion at the board level, and ultimately the board denied
that request.
The initiation of that conditional use permit requests stemmed from some complaints that
the planning department had received about events at the property.
We did not pursue any enforcement of the violation because the applicant was trying
to bring the property into compliance by going forward with the conditional use permit
application.
When that was denied, we became aware of through complaints that at least one event
and possibly more were held on the property subsequent to that denial, so it's my understanding
that the applicant is seeking this permit as a way to try and continue with events.
The application came in with five dates being requested, but because of the timeline
for advertisement of public hearings, et cetera, and the board's meeting schedule to those
dates have come and gone, so those aren't really before you at this point.
It's the three dates that have yet to occur that we're looking for a decision on this
request for the festival permit.
Mr. Chair and can add additional detail if the board would like, but that's sort
of how we arrive here this evening.
I'm happy to answer any questions if you have them on the staff, and I know the applicant
is represented here tonight.
Thank you, sir.
Questions, Mr. Chair, anyone?
Mr. Chairmen.
Mr. Chairmen.
Mr. Chairmen.
Mr. Chairmen.
Mr. Chairmen.
Mr. Chairmen.
Mr. Chairmen.
Mr. Chairmen.
Chairmen.
I think there's some somebody else that the applicant had made a request back in 2018,
and then they made another request in 2019.
Can you just review the time line of what has occurred?
There was a festival permit granted for the property at some point in 2018 to my knowledge
that event went off without a vet.
I'm not aware that we received complaints.
«In that was really a non issue, I guess at this point. Then there was events held without a professional permit
which we received complaints for which resulted in our zoning enforcement staff getting involved,
a notice of violation was sent to the property owner, and ultimately they pursued a CUP for an

yet the I have had complaints
of at first one event at this point—we
haven't really, you know thoroughly investigated
that—to find out whether or not
a violation occurred.
The reasonably—the repeat I asked is
the request tonight, process includes
dates that have already passed.
Correct.
So that's what I was just asking correct.
Thank you Mr. chairman.
Naia other questions, Mr. Tierney.
Mr. lanemons, anything you'd like to add?
I am Cindy Layman at the back creek district thank you for letting me speak yes in fact we did
start our journey back in 2018 with the festival permit when we did try to pursue our CUP
through at the first level through the planning commission there was issues regarding the
easement that we purchased from Mr. Ranker to be able to use that to access our property
so until that could get resolved at that point we could present to the board so we the CUP was
table we were informed that we could continue to have events as long as there were a hundred
people or less which is what we did and then we received the notice that we were in violation
of the ordinance so at that point we immediately sought to obtain the CUP retain council because
we felt strongly that we had the right to use the easement that we purchased that was still denied
so where we are now is to use our existing driveway I've met with VDOT and Mr.
Lofton was at that meeting to determine a safe way to eliminate Mr. Ranker's objection to
using his road and to utilize our and sub our in driveway so based on that meeting and looking
at different options we've sought the use of the sheriff's department to provide his traffic
control to turn in and to have a right exit only which eliminates really any hazard that we have
so we have contacted Sheriff Mill Holland and he's agreed to support us with the traffic control
we will not use Mr. Ranker's road in any way does it be fringe in his subdivision in any way
and we're just trying to get through to this year that's where we are thank any questions
ladies and gentlemen you mentioned that you were holding festivals of 100 people or less because
that's what you understood the requirement to be and it should be my understanding that you're
now just carrying out contracts that you entered into at the time that you thought 100 people
or less was acceptable correct then can you explain to me why three of the at least two of the
events have more than 100 people listed on the application that is the maximum that the
the people tell us but typically it's far less than that we didn't want to be misleading in that
number because we had booked these with the understanding we thought we were going to get our
CUP and we were up to 180 people we felt the 125 would be not an issue so again we're just trying
to honor the county residents that are coming to our farm to have their wedding and not ruin their
wedding that's really where we are thank you other questions I guess my question is after the
CUP was turned down and at that point you at that point you knew not to have
any more whether it was 100 or 50 or whatever you weren't supposed to have any more but you did
we had a family reunion we had a family reunion yes but in any time we had anyone
well more than one activity we had two other events which we had the sheriff come out which
knew we were going to have a few people more than a normal amount of people and we did not want
there to be any issue using Mr. Rinker's road and we contacted the sheriff department to ensure
that we had a safe entrance because our family has been using that entrance so you have family
reunion two other events we had one other and that was a non-family amount correct we did not
have time to cancel on that wedding other questions we're on their wedding other questions
of Ms. Layman anyone thank you ma'am this is a public hearing what anyone liked to comment
concerning this proposed festival permit I just had one question if I could please respond to
any comments after after I said not after the public hearing I don't well let's let's do it
we'll see public hearing anyone thank you sir we could have your name magisterial district and
limit your comments to three minutes or less please sir Thomas Hills and we leave at the back
quick district also our property backs up to the wavelength form driveway 500 feet approximately
and our home is about 700 yards or a long part five you goffers from our house to their
facility from what we have seen they have conducted their gatherings in a very responsible way
there hasn't been any disorder there hasn't been any disruption any loud noises I don't know
what these complaints are that you've heard of but certainly our position physically where
property is we would be first hand to hear of anything that was out of order I think what
they're doing for the preservation of the farm to have a small operation to offset the expenses
of a going concern is admirable I think it should be supported I think having an anniversary's
weddings birthdays reunions of families in a historic facility like the barn dating back to 1845
going back to the 1700s when Lord Fairfax granted the land I think is admirable I think more
farmers should be able to do this kind of function or something along those lines just to be able
to keep the farm and the open space available in the county so it's their dream to have this
going on and it's their dream to continue with this and I think the board should support their
dream as we do all right thank you very much I appreciate it we don't do that one you don't do that
no sir thank you thank you we're here to listen would anyone like yes ma'am
evening put my girlfriend there you go my name is Pam Simmers and I live in the back creek district
I am at 186 Heights Road and I have been there for 30 years if you walk down my driveway across
Heights Road and walk through the field or the orchard for about 10 minutes I'll be at
send these back door I've known the layman's and the Huey's most of the 30 years we've lived there
the only way I know that they're having a wedding is if I happen to drop by their house and see
the ten out front I've never heard any loud noises and I do hear noises from the wantery which
is on the other side of me but I've never heard any noise coming from the layman's I go over
there quite often to check in on Mrs Huey and I've never seen any trash anything out of order
they take such good care of the property I've had the pleasure of being at two of the events
that they've held and it's just a beautiful place and I think it's a good choice they give
the residents of their county to have their events for example one of my sons in his wife got
married and they put for a lot of these barn weddings were popular and they had to go out
to Middleburg to have their wedding and pay just exorbitant amount of money to be married
under a tree so I think this is a great thing that they're doing and I think the committee should
absolutely support them as I do thank you is there anyone else who would like to speak concerning
this festival permit good evening I'm Dudley Rinker back Creek representing Rinker properties
we were here about six weeks ago for this whole thing four posed to it at that time I didn't know
anything of this part until about five o'clock this evening so I'm not very well prepared they've
had two events since that August meeting August 7th and again this past weekend they did have
a deputy sitting at the top of the hill again on our property with lights flashing and is that
the county's expense are they paying for that or whatever we are opposed to it we just don't
want to be setting a president that we're okay with this with the event center in the future
I know that there's another neighbor in the same subdivision as the person that spoke
and he was wondering where all the noise was coming from after the last meeting I told him
where it was and you know he was surprised and so he has heard the noise from the event center
so that's it thank you thank you sir is there anyone else who would like to speak concerning
this festival permit application welcome thank you I'm Debbie Raimi I'm back Creek District also
I'm sorry I'm Cindy sister I had the pleasure of growing up at Wavelin Farm my whole life
to take that barn away from all our people in Frederick County and all around us is a sad sad
thing we've had parties there since I was a little child and there's no more noise or any
noise that I've ever heard or seen our house has never been disrupted in any way it's never
been a negative impact on any of us and we're very proud that Cindy's undertaken this thing
and speaking of noise Mr. Ranker has a lot of noise at his events and a lot of traffic and
other chaotic issues that he should deal with and not really worry with ours
is there anyone else who would like to comment concerning this application anyone
anyone at all anything you'd like to address it you've heard Ms. Lehman
we can't hear you until you get to the microphone I'm sorry a little nervous I would like
to address the other complaint from another neighbor I've never received any complaints verbally
or in writing I actually had six letters submitted to the board at the last CUP from
neighboring properties all in support of our venue so I'm curious as to who Mr. Ranker speaking
with and if they did have an issue I'd be more than willing to meet with them and see if there's
a way we can resolve that the noise if any is music on a stereo inside our barn in the back
corner usually our weddings are done by nine I mean it's a long day they leave so I'm really not
that's my question is to just like to know what the complaint is so that I could address it
I'm sure folks have heard that thank you all right we're going to close the public comment
portion of the discussion this is back creek Mr. Chairman I would move to approve the
outdoor festival permit because to believe on farm LLC and secretary Lehman
heard the motion is our second Mr. Chairman I'll second it second just so that I can make a
motion to amend it I'd like to move to amend the motion to limit the size of any event to 100
because that was what the original contracts were supposedly predicated upon so it's very
most I think there should be a limit of 100 people versus 152 people or 25 people sorry okay so now
we're discussing an amendment if we have a second you have a second for the proposed amendment
any praise your proposed amendment will die for like a second certain all right discussion
motion to approve supervisor loft Mr. Chairman I need to take responsibility I think for us being
here at this point when I was first contacted by the layman's based on what they had told me
I reiterated their permit code to them and I'm afraid I may have misled them based on what I
knew about the 100 people but when we found out that it was going to be different then that's
when we started looking for alternatives to the entrance and in that meantime the layman's based
upon the process that we have set out and the CUP which I like I indicated that I thought there
was a resolution basically to the entrance was my biggest problem with that and so I think that's
partly why we were here today debating whether or not we should allow these three I really do
think we should the laymans have been diligently trying to resolve this issue we know that the issue
through the adjoining property was not the most desirable outcome and so that was denied the
laymans are still pursuing other avenues to get that done this just gives them the flexibility
to hold those events that they had already committed to and as Mrs. layman has said she and I met
with feed on and later I contacted Sheriff Millholland Sheriff Millholland actually came to the site
he sent a deputy to the site he indicated that he felt that they had a plan where they could
make the entrance and exit to the layman farm through their existing entrance safe and it has
worked so with that in mind and the fact that Mrs. layman has contracted with the Sheriff's
Department to provide their services again if we should approve these events then I think that we
ought to give them the opportunity to fulfill their commitment to these events there is no there
are no houses except painter's hill which is probably quarter mile away to the closest house
and I myself have not heard any complaints from any of the residents in painter's hill
about noise traffic or any other issues that have been associated with the events have
been held there at that venue so I think that we would be remiss if we would not allow them to
finish out this year if this UP as it comes back in if you do not feel that it is a proper use
for that farm given all the circumstances that are associated with it then that's fine but I
think that we should give them the opportunity to fulfill these commitments for this year and
they work on their conditions use permit for the future all right further discussion anyone
this chairman surprised her well I spoke with Mrs. layman on the phone so she knows I did
and I expressed to her and I've expressed before and Mr. McCarthy I think feels the same way
CUPs are certainly not my favorite thing we discussed that at the planning commission today
and they're certainly a lot of them so I don't know how we control 100 people west oaks has a
hard time controlling I was speaking with my wife this afternoon I said so you know you open up
and people come and you get the 200 you have the guy there and he closes the gate and says sorry
you can't come to this wedding because you're 200 and we can only have 199 that's not going to happen
there's going to be 250 there's going to be 150 there's going to be whatever that's not up to
the sheriff to do he's just directing traffic not counting cars or people coming in so it's kind
of ridiculous to put the number on it because you can't control the number we can't control CUPs
it's pretty obvious and further counting we can't do that we don't don't have the wherewithal
that being said we allow it it is on our books at this time and that's what I told Ms. layman
even though I don't like the idea it has been permitted and I certainly understand that
I've not heard any complaints about noise or anything like that I'm not in that district but
haven't heard anybody complain about that I am a little disappointed that we had events
knowing full well that weren't supposed to have events we did have events that's that's just
point I must say but anyway I've said in the piece thank you very much further discussion
anyone Mr. Chairman Supervisor McCarthy I would reiterate Supervisor Wells's sentiment about being
disappointed you know we have ordinances laws for purpose and that's to make sure everyone's
following the same rules I'm abiding by the same restrictions and I'm sure there's a lot of
folks out there that would like to do things and know that they don't have the proper permits or the
proper CUP so they don't do them that being said though Supervisor Lofton mentioned that you
know he feels that he may have some responsibility and a miscommunication with the applicant where
they misunderstood what was required and if these contracts were signed at that time I can
understand too the feeling that I have some contractual obligation to fulfill my duty to the
people who signed the contract that being said it's really hard when I'm being told I understood
I could have up to 100 but yet the application says 125 it's hard for me to approve this
application for 125 people when the whole idea of why we're sitting here was predicated on the
fact that I thought I could have up to 100 so if the contract was signed for up to 125 then you
then there was an intentional sort of overstepping of what you were allowed to do so I'm really
torn here it seems like every hour today I'm kind of back and forth back and forth looking at
this one and it's a tough one in one breath I think we have an obligation as a board to uphold
the ordinances and the law and another I think you know we have the obligation to look at things
and say is this an allowable use that will benefit a member of our community and not hand
or someone else in our community so it's this balancing act at this point I think based on what
supervisor Lawton said I would be willing to vote in favor of these next three events
but I would just say I hope that there will be no other events without a CUP because it's a disservice
not only to this board and flaunting those ordinances but it's a disservice to all your community
members who are abiding by those ordinances you know we're expected to hold each other to account
and to abide by those laws so as supervisor well says it's real disappointment when we see that
not happening so I understand there's circumstances but circumstances don't mean that you can
do the wrong thing so I'll vote in favor of this on these particular events these next three
but that's where I'm going to draw the line on this one thank you sir any further comments
anyone supervisor done like mr McCarthy I wrestle with this for most of the day
um I'm disappointed that after the board voted to deny CUP that there was another event after
that so I was on marble road on the seventh and I spoke to a policeman who said that there was an
event that's occurring there I'm also very cognizant of the fact that apparently you have a
wedding schedule for this Saturday but we voted on the CUP before one of the issues was
traffic and coming over marble road how do you prevent four or five cars or about to turn left
into your property from being rear-ended and so when I was there earlier this month I asked
this and they they had the lens lights on etc but I trusted that hill I had no idea what I was
going to say and the police officer was just literally there at the side and he would not have
known what was on the other side of the hill too so traffic was a big issue the last time we
talked about this if you had addressed the traffic issue in your first CUP and said you know how do
we address this I would have been more open to listen but I'm really disappointed that
after the board votes that you just continue to have not only two others but you're scheduled
to have another four one of which is Saturday and that's just frustrating so therefore mr
chairman I'm going to make an amendment and amendment would be so they can have one for this
Saturday only and the next two need to be they cannot have and that you'd have to just go
and find another venue I think there's a bride and groom there could be very surprised
tomorrow morning depending on how this board votes but I'm just disappointed that you couldn't
go and comply if you were making business decisions you could at least set contingent upon
something but that's my frustration so thank you mr oh so I'll make the motion to see if there's
a second I've heard the proposed amendment is there a second anyone sir you'll or amendment
offer will die for lack of a second thank you mr chairman I do think that it's time that we
back out look at the big picture I think everyone's disappointed with the way this one has gone
including the the community and the neighbor of it get them through a year I do hope that we see
a conditional use permit application prior to anything happening after this that can be approved
by the board that's my opinion anyone else who provides a lot chairman just to wrap this up
I agree with your comments and the layman's have indicated that this will be wrap up their
events for this year again I know that they're diligently working on the next CUP application
again we've met with VDOT we've met with a sheriff we're trying to make sure that all the issues
that have been raised have been are going to be addressed in that CUP application
further discussion anyone rise or done no supervisor lofton hi supervisor well
supervisor slaughter no supervisor McCarthy one two three the chair votes i the motion
carries the festival permit is approved as applied please don't disappoint us again thank you
all right that will bring us to planning commission business
proposed ordinance amendments decline yes sir good evening mr chairman members of the board of
supervisors this is an ordinance amendment discussion for public utilities this is a
proposed amendment to chapter 165 the zoning ordinance to provide a definition for public utilities
that includes utility scale solar power energy generating facilities and provides additional
supplemental regulations for specific uses that requires utility scale solar generating
energy facilities to make arrangements including financial security for decommissioning
consistent with and as required by the code of Virginia and to provide site plan review and
approval only for utility scale solar power generating facilities the intent of this text
amendment is to codify a determination that utility scale solar power generating facilities
would be considered a public utility and to codify recent changes to the code of Virginia
to include decommissioning for solar energy facilities this text amendment also cleans up
terminology for public utilities throughout the zoning ordinance the text amendment does not
amend requirements for other types of utilities including those facilities owned and operated
by Frederick water the development review and regulations committee or drc discuss this item
extensively at their June 27 July 25 in August 22 regular meetings the drc supported the proposed
changes the item then went to the planning commission for discussion on September the fourth
who and they also discuss the item and recommended to go forward to the board for discussion
this item is presented to this body this evening for discussion and staff is seeking direction
from the board as to whether this item is ready to be sent forward to a public hearing
as the staff person to the drc i'm happy to answer any questions this board may have about
this text amendment thank you questions of mr clang so you provide your love mr clang
perhaps i've missed it here but what can give a definition of utility scale utility scale is
going to be a type of facility where the power is generated to be sold back to another utility
company it would not be where someone is generating power for their own consumption but
where the power is being generated to be sold to a dominion power or another power utility company
should do i think that definition should be included is our definition is there something here
that tells me that the definition for public utilities is up and that the definition that we've
included is that they are power generating facilities booster relay stations transformers
substations transmission lines and towers pipes meters and other facilities including utility
scale solar power generating facilities and sewer water treatment facilities including
sewer water transmission lines the key here is that such facilities may be owned by public utilities
public agencies those operators with a certificate of public convenience or those that are operating
under a permit by rule so we have said i think a minimum of six acres i have so we're generating
facilities on we do not have a minimum acreage threshold as part of this amendment
do we have it someplace else in our code we do not it was part of a previous text amendment that
was not moved forward by the board but this amendment does not specify a minimum or maximum acreage
for such a facility but the definition would be that it's being sold to the grid basically
it's it deals with the ownership regarding public utilities public agencies similar agencies
are those operating with a certificate of public convenience other questions missed by anyone
this chair i have two questions one follows one supervisor lofton's question that's the
definition of public utility not the definition of a utility scale solar power generating
facility i don't know if the state has a definition of that that we can incorporate into the
ordinance which i would like to see the second comment i have is when we say that we're selling
they are selling the energy back to a utility versus using it for personal consumption my
understanding of most solar powered arrays even for residential are not actually utilizing
the power directly for their own personal consumption but they're actually selling it back to
the utility which then rolls back their meter versus using it themselves so it can there be
some clarification as to that aspect of it too so that those residential uses like even a large
farm that might have a very large array wouldn't fall under a definition of one of these utility
sized solar generating we certainly could look at incorporating such aspect to the definition
providing a separate definition for utility scale if you recall we did the county attorney
and staff did provide a determination last summer about why we felt like utility scale solar
could be lumped into the public utilities allowed use that's already spelled out in the zoning
ordinance at that time we did not have a public utility definition in which case we defer to
webster's dictionary so the the definitions provided as an effort by staff in the county attorney
to kind of codify what we believe our definition is it also includes how spelled out in other parts
of the ordinance I appreciate that I think if we could get a little bit more clarity in the
ordinance itself because I'm thinking as I think to the future you know for instance a 20 kilowatt
array could take up you know the better part of an acre for a farm and if I want to run a pretty
large farm operation I may need a hundred kilowatts of energy from a solar array so you know I'm
thinking you know I don't want to see our local farmers in the future be hampered with using
a part of their acreage to help offset utility costs in order to run that farm if we can
simply just put some simple language in here that would exempt them from any falling under this
in any way I can I can defer to mr. Williams the county attorney our interpretation has been
that people that are doing it on their private property again for specifically to power their
individual property where some of it may be sold back would not fall under public utility and
mr. Williams can can clarify that I believe mr. chairman I but I think we can go either way
on that I understand however the the need or desire for a definition I mean we can certainly craft
one it certainly doesn't hurt it's most likely more than adequate as it stands but clarity is
always a good thing so we could come up with a definition that encompasses what mr. lofton
mr. McCarthy suggested thank you sir is terny did you want to well I'm honestly just sitting here
pondering but I'm I'm wondering if in the end it becomes a irrelevant distinction because if I'm
using it to power my own farm it's a by right use so do we need to distinguish what I'm doing on
for my own personal consumption what this does is make a utility scale it makes it clear that
is a public utility which is also allowed by right so both uses are about allowed by right we don't
regulate them I understand if we're going to use the term we ought to know what we're saying
but in the end they're both permitted uses right man I suspect we can find some clarity
but I mean even those folks who have larger rays powering whatever it is that they choose to
power with it there there are times when they're using it all plus buying some their times when
they're getting credit for some which is is exactly what we're looking for I mean it's all positive
stuff in my book I happen to be a hundred percent supportive of this what I haven't found in all
the documentation is a clearer definition of decommissioning and how we guarantee that over time
does that come into play the supplemental or did I miss it in the supplemental uses we provide
a statement regarding decommissioning which refers back to the state code section so those
requirements are outlined in the state code section I didn't find it in there anyway I support
this step I want to see that step accomplished and clarified is all is all I mean by my comment
yes sir other discussion with chairman just one on the on the decommission I had a conversation
with staff earlier but I'd also support the chairman's comment that when the issue is finished and
if there's a decommissioning so you return the land to the way it was meant to be and that should
be determined up front that when the project is finished it's referred to you know whatever's
predetermined should be the end decommissioning is a component of the permit by rule which is a part
of the solar application that applicants need to go through with the state the commonwealth
in Virginia so they are decommissioning you plan as part of that it's essentially a checklist if
they check all the boxes in the permit by rule one of which is decommissioning also stormwater
management they will satisfy the state code requirements which would subsequently satisfy our
supplemental uses as they're proposed I found just looking to make it certain that it goes back to
the way it was before operation begins that's all yes sir thank you yeah I found that and
the code what I didn't find is is how localities protect themselves against those folks who no
longer exist or can be found and I didn't find it in the state code I mr chairman yes the the
state code provision road would require the owner to post some form of financial security a cash
us grow bond letter of credit with the commonwealth through with the locality okay all right good
enough thank you that was my concern further discussion anyway so the request is for adoption
of a resolution hold the public hearing to move this forward is chairman yes sir I have some
of motion sir second and a second sir further discussion supervise McCarthy supervise
a slaughter supervise a well supervise a loft supervise a done by chair votes high and motion
carries all right thank you that mr Klein yes this is again an ordinance amendment for discussion
in regards to conditional uses in the R.A. rural areas zoning district the purpose of this amendment
is to add clarity to specific uses where the intensity of a given use is important in considering
its appropriateness for a conditional use permit or CUP and to provide consistency in the allowance
an implementation of certain uses in the zoning district the board of supervisors directed the
planning commission to evaluate our conditional use permit process and those uses listed as
conditional uses in the R.A. zoning district to ensure that the uses and the scale of the uses
were appropriate for the zoning district in which they were allowed this proposed amendment
to the zoning ordinance further defines the conditional use country general store to exclude
all fuel sales and to cap the maximum square footage allowed at 3,500 square feet it also provides
additional supplemental use regulations for specific uses specifically the country general store
it eliminates combines and refines certain conditional uses on the conditional use list
and it codifies zoning determinations relating to home occupations cottage occupations
and kennels to reduce the number of conditional use permit applications the development review
and regulations discuss this item at their August 22nd regular meeting and the DRRC supported
the proposed changes the planning commission discuss the item on September the 4th and this
item is presented to the board of supervisors for discussion following your discussion this
evening staff is seeking direction from the board of supervisors as to whether this item is
ready to be sent forward for public hearing staff is available to answer any questions you may have
thank you mr chairman thank you sir questions mr Klein anyone
yes sir I guess whether a specific incidence that brought forward it appears that the
convenient store general store it on a call was the focus of a lot of this were it was at the
genesis of the CUP revision where there were more incidents of other uses that were discussed or
was that just basically the focus of the country general store was the impetus for this discussion
but when we got into the conditional useless we identified several uses that had never received
conditional use permits we identified several uses that were either duplicative or conflicting
with one another so what you'll see on the revised useless is some of those uses were combined
some that were no longer appropriate or didn't ever exist were eliminated and others that we
felt were no longer conditional uses became allowed uses it shortened the list the country general
store again was the main impetus a lot of country general stores were approved and they subsequently
became convenient stores with fuel pumps and they were doing diesel sales and had hours of operation
that conflicted with neighboring residential uses so it was in order to kind of reign in that
use in particular so like I said although that was a dentist you did get the whole basket of CUP
then to narrow it down to what we have here yes sir we looked at the last 20 years of approved
uses to go through that and we also provided a comparison of some of the country general
stores that are out there versus what they would be like in the suburban area of the county okay thank
you other questions of mr clan anyone when I look at article four under agricultural and
residential districts you have stricken fruit packing plants so I'm assuming the reason for
that is because you're saying that over the last 20 years there have been in certain instances
in in fruit packing plants we just considered that under agricultural which isn't allowed use
so it was in order to make that use just allowed by right not require except because it's
kind of accessory to other agricultural activities so the permitted use agricultural activities
encompasses a lot of activities and some of those were stricken from the conditional list and
just were lumped into that so about more or less a by right use as opposed to something permitted
under this article yes ma'am good that is correct thank you other questions of mr clan anyone
okay is it ready to send forward to public hearing
let's say I don't know the leave I'm sorry
five and go ahead I'm going to say it up first I wish we had you want to go Doug
I'll make the motion to move the forward to public okay
I'm not putting another comment second second all right so motion is second to send forward to public
hearings or any further discussion all those in favor I like pose now we'll send that forward
to public hearing all right right I didn't want to go so that brings us to board liaison
reports are there any mr chairman sir faster died so last week the Northern Shenandoah
Valley Digital Commission had a meeting in which we discussed not only Frederick County but
Frederick County and joining counties working together to deal with the recycling issue as you
know we were trying to work through something by the end of the year other counties have a
similar concerns so this regional commission is seeing what we can do as a collective group
to try to address the recycling issues that affect all of us thank you sir
the other board liaison reports anyone all right seeing none citizen comments this is a
portion of the meeting we set aside for citizen comments on any issue whatsoever is there any
one who would like to speak do you want it all last call close the citizen comment portion or
the supervisors comments are there any mr chairman supervisor died in this community which is rich
rich in history there was an opening last week and on the third battle Winchester and there's
a local gentleman mr. Wilkins who donated a considerable amount of money to help with that
openings so I think we just have to appreciate people in this area they're willing to put their
own dollars in for the greater good at that battle also there's a situation which a Confederate
soldier was shot and wounded in one of the attacks a union soldier then gave him a log to hide
behind for the counter attack I'm sure to come and so that just shows how people can work together
even though they're mortal enemies and Lincoln studies second gettysburg address he talked about
finding out the nation's wounds you know the political parade that we have today we need to do
that thank you mr chairman thank you sir for the comments anyone chairman loft the chairman
and I move we adjourn as to adjourn is our second we'll stand adjourn we thank everyone for their
time attention and their input
