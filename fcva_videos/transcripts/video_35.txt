I'm going to call the meeting into order, please.
Very fortunate to see you again to have Pastor Ross Halbersema from the new Hope Alliance
Church to deliver our invocation. I really appreciate you being with us, sir.
Father God, creator of the universe, the giver of life and the sustainer of life. We
give thanks to you for a new year. We enter a new decade. Thank you for those who
serve the needs of our community and this county, those who serve as elected officials,
those who are hired to serve, those who volunteer to serve, those who will be
appointed to serve, may our service be done in such a manner that you are honored
and glorified as the creator and the sustainer of our world, your world,
including this place in which we inhabit. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
We'll bring us to the organization of the board, pursuant to the code of Virginia. Item number
A is a election of a vice chairman. Mr. Chairman, I'm not sure if it's a nomination or a motion,
but I'd like to place Bob Wells' name in a vice chair. It's a motion. It's our second.
Second.
Any discussion? Supervisor Fisher? Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy? Aye. Supervisor Slotter? Aye.
Supervisor Wells? Aye. Supervisor Dunn? Aye.
Supervisor Graber? Aye.
Chair votes aye. Motion carries.
Supervisor Wells, will we be our vice chairman for this year? Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir. Two years ago in a similar situation, another time in, wait, I guess Mr. Loftin,
or Mr. Wells, and I made a comment that Mr. Loftin be unanimously nominated.
So I'll make the same motion here, even though I voted against Mr. Wells.
I'll make the same motion that the board reflected to say unanimous decision.
That's a motion.
Motion is our second. Second.
Second. It's any discussion? All those in favor aye.
Aye. Aye. Opposed no.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman, Wells will be elected unanimously.
All right. Adoption of the rules of procedure.
Yes, sir. Mr. Chairman, I move that the board adopt the rules of procedures, originally adopted by the Frederick County Board of Supervisors on May 28, 2003, amended January 8, 2020, and Robert's rules of order, simplified and applied.
All right. You've heard the motions are second.
Sorry. In the second. Is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir. Mr. Chair.
At the very least, I'd like more time to consider some of the rules looking at them.
I think a lot of them are common sense. Some of them I don't see that it's kind of like we're trying to find a solution to a problem that hasn't existed that I haven't seen.
So at the very least, I'd like to see us take more time to review these before we adopt these additional rules.
Okay. Further discussion?
Mr. Chairman, surprised or not?
I'd also say that before we adopt these, I'd like to either strike the items in red, which we'll give us back to what we had before, and if we want to have a more comprehensive discussion on this, we can take it point by point.
I'm sorry. The last part.
Sorry.
I was going to move to go and strike the items in red, and then which was then give us to where we were last year, same rules of procedures.
And then if the board has an interest in going through somebody's other items in red outline, we can just do it point by point in a work session or something in that nature.
We would need to work on them.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, in a consensus building.
Correct.
A second. Supervisor Dunn's motion to amend.
We had a motion.
The desire is discussion.
I think he just said he made his motion to amend.
That motion is a motion to amend.
Correct.
Okay. And a second.
Second.
And a second.
Okay. Is there any further discussion?
Anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I would further agree with what Mr. Dunn has implied here.
There are several items that I worry may be not in compliance with the state code is currently already written.
And I believe that we need to have the all items in red struck down and then have a consensus of this board of what the rules will be moving forward.
I appreciate the time.
Okay.
Further discussion, anyone?
So we're going to vote on a motion to amend, to strike all of the red, adopt everything that's not in red, and then continue the discussion.
Are we all clear?
Supervisor Fisher.
Hi.
Vice McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Yeah.
Supervisor Wells.
Hi.
Supervisor Dunn.
Hi.
Supervisor Graver.
Hi.
The selection of a parliamentarian traditionally that has been Mr. Tierney County.
Chairman.
That was a motion to amend.
Oh, sorry.
Yes.
Motion to amend and now the motion.
So this is the amended motion to strike everything in red and nothing in black and continue to work on the amendments.
We're clear.
Supervisor Graver.
I'm sorry.
I was not clear.
Could you repeat that?
Say aye.
We voted to amend the motion, which we did.
Now we're voting on the amended motion, which was to strike the red, adopt the black, continue the consensus discussion.
Very good.
My vote is aye.
Okay.
Supervisor Dunn.
Hi.
Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Slaughter.
No.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Fisher.
Hi.
Chair votes aye.
We'll adopt the amended motion.
We'll adopt all the black.
We'll continue a discussion about the red and the future.
All right.
A selection of a parliamentarian.
Physically it's been Mr. Tierney County Administrator.
Mr. Chairman, I would move at the board, elect the County Administrator as parliamentarian.
Her dimension is our second.
The second, is there any discussion?
Anyone?
All those in favor aye?
Aye.
Opposed now?
One now.
You select Mr. Tierney as our parliamentarian.
A selection time and place for regular meetings.
Mr. Chairman, I would move at the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month at 7 p.m.
In the Board of Supervisors Meeting Room, County Administration Building at 107 North Kent Street.
Winchester, Virginia.
Be the time and meeting place for the Frederick County Board of Supervisors for 2020.
With the exception of the November 11th meeting, which shall be held Thursday November 12th,
because of the Veterans Day holiday, I further move that should a meeting be cancelled due to
inclement weather.
It will take place on the following evening.
All right.
Her dimension is our second.
Second.
In the second.
Is there any discussion?
This has been our normal procedure for ever since I can remember.
We all good?
Mr. Baza Gray.
Hi.
Mr. Baza Redone.
Hi.
Mr. Baza Wells.
Hi.
Mr. Baza Slutter.
Hi.
Mr. Baza McCarty.
Mr. Baza Fisher.
Hi.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
We will adopt those.
Chairman's annual Committee assignments.
I haven't heard from folks.
Everyone I have heard from seems to be OK with them.
And you have the Board Committee assignments in front of you.
The citizen assignments will deal with at our next meeting.
and I appreciate your patience.
So entertain a motion for you all to confirm those.
So move.
Mr. Chairman, if that could first only get the bottom there
under the Frederick Winchester Service Authority.
I'm sorry.
We'll need to yell at the bottom.
Yes, what's your question?
I'm no longer a member on the service authority.
You are.
How would you like to be?
For sure.
I'll put you there.
I think this board put Mr. Lawrence on there.
Are you adding me back on there?
As a board member.
As a board member.
Okay.
And that's a different work for you.
I might as well get on that too.
We did talk about that.
Okay.
All right.
Motion to confirm.
I think Bob had a motion, and I moved.
Bob, so moved.
And I second.
Any discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed?
No.
Any questions?
As you further study, please get with me.
We'll fix them.
All right.
That leads us a citizen member assignments at our next meeting.
And that takes care of that item.
Adoption of the.
Adoption of the agenda.
The motion to adopt the agenda is presented.
Second.
Second.
Any discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed?
No.
We'll adopt the agenda.
This is a portion of the meeting.
We set aside for citizen comments on agenda items that are not subject to public hearing.
Anyone sign up, Ms. Phillips?
Yes, sir.
Mark Berg.
Mr. Berg.
Yes, I'm Mark Berg, back creek district.
I'm glad to see that some of the votes turned out well as far as I was considering this.
But I was a little concerned here when I saw the agenda that it's not.
It didn't give me a chance to comment on some of this stuff and there's still some issues that need to be taken care of.
As one of the members said here on the board, the changes to the code of conduct and the other things.
There were a number of issues that do not comply with the state code in that.
And I plan to since this is going to be done in the future, get in touch with my board of supervisors and discuss that more to make sure that's not an issue.
And there are also other things with that that are wrong and have been carried over apparently.
They're unchanged.
I'll bring that up with my board of supervisors, member two.
The adoption of the rules and this agenda is a little bit strange.
The way it's been before in the rules and what you were going to vote on this time, even with the changes in red, said that the order was not as you did it today.
In fact, it says in the agenda, an article for it, says that it will conform to the order of business specified in section 401.
You had changed it to 51 actually when you changed some of the things.
But that had the call to order invocation, special allegiance, adoption of the agenda and citizens comments.
And then it had business and what you just did was business and should have been after.
So I'm going to comment on comments, unfortunately, and not going to be as apropos.
Like I say, something's turned out well, so I don't have to comment on them, but nonetheless.
I'm going to comment on the parliamentarian because that also is a potential problem.
That I see, especially what potentially was passed, that would have been a real problem because you had written in there that board of supervisors members were not allowed to talk to other people.
There was a restraint on communication there.
And it would have actually precluded the board of supervisors members from talking to the parliamentarian because he's an employee of the county.
So you got to be very careful when what's written in there. But luckily, that's not the issue.
There is one other thing.
Members of the county administrator actually is kind of beholden to the board.
And the way it was written too with those other issues, he was more beholden to the chairman because the chairman was the one that did the talking between who he hired.
In other words, it wasn't up to the other board of supervisors members.
So unfortunately, there's an incentive for that for that parliamentarian to vote in the way he thinks the chairman is a given opinion, the way he thinks the chairman would want it to go.
That's not difficult to do. And I've seen that in my experience, both in my experience in the public party of Virginia, in the House of delegates.
So I know what happens. So anyway, that's probably all I have. I appreciate your time and I look forward to being able to offer my opinions in the future.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Anyone else?
That's all, sir.
Is there anyone else who wanted to comment, gender items, not subject to public hearing, anyone at all?
Thank you.
We'll move forward.
Consent agenda.
I would the board like to handle a consent agenda.
Mr. Chairman, I make a motion that we approve the consent agenda as presented.
The motion to approve is presented as a second second.
Second. Is there any discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman, I would just make note that I will be abstaining from this vote as I was not privileged to being in all of the meetings that are on this agenda.
Understood, sir. Thank you.
Any further discussion, anyone?
All right. Supervisor Dunn?
Hi.
Supervisor Will.
Hi.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Supervisor Fisher.
Mr. Chairman, vote for me with a couple of these.
We're not all up and just to clarify.
All right, sir.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
We'll adopt the consent agenda.
Board of Supervisors, comments.
Are there any?
Anyone?
All right.
Recommendation of the 19, 2019 employee of the year.
Deputy Lambert, would you join us, please, sir?
Are we good?
So Deputy Greg E. Lambert was recognized as the Frederick County's employee of the year for 2019 at the December holiday gathering.
Deputy Lambert's assigned as a surveillance officer for the Northwest Region Adult Drug Court, where he's known to be tough but compassionate with drug court participants, offering counsel as well as constructive criticism when appropriate.
He brings meaningful insights regarding the commitment of individuals in their recovery, has an intense working knowledge of the people he is charged with supervising.
Deputy Lambert is tireless in his efforts to assist recovering addicts, and on more than one occasion, has purchased shoes, toiletries, and other essentials for program participants, who lack the financial means to purchase those items.
Deputy Lambert was commended by an officer of the court for going above and beyond the call of duty, working long hours, and never shurking his responsibilities.
His proactive approach, compassion and leadership have helped make the Northwest Region Adult Drug Court program successful.
The board gratefully commends Deputy Greg E. Lambert for his outstanding performance and dedication, and thanks him for his skillful service to the Northwest Region Adult Drug Court, and we wish him continued success in future endeavors.
Please join me in congratulating and thanking Deputy Lambert for a job well done.
All done.
The committee appointments, we have the Planning Commission, a four-year term of page manual, Shawnee District.
Mr. Chairman, I have spoken with Mr. Manual, he is willing to serve again and would move to reappoint him to the Planning Commission.
All right, sir, you've heard the motion is there a second.
Second.
There's a second. Is there any discussion? Anyone? All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed now.
Mr. Manual is reappointed, Extension Leadership Council. This one's back Creek.
Mr. Chairman, it's been an honor to get to know and work with Mr. Monk, and after speaking with him, he desires to be reappointed, so I would thereby move to reappoint Brandon Monk as the back Creek District Representative on the Extension Leadership Council.
Thank you, sir. He heard the motion is there a second.
And the second. Is there any discussion? All those in favor? Aye.
Opposed now. Brandon Monk is reappointed as the back Creek District Rep on the Extension Leadership Council.
Frederick Water Board of Directors, it's an unexpired term. We have an application from Hank Slowinsky.
Entertain a motion.
So moved.
And a motion to appoint, sir, second. Second.
And the second. Is there any discussion? Anyone? All those in favor? Aye.
Opposed now. We'll reappoint. Well, appoint Hank Slowinsky to the Frederick Water Board of Directors.
Dominion Asset Policy Board, three-year term of Mr. Tips. How would the board like to handle this one?
Motion to nominate Mr. Tips. Motion to point. Second.
Absolutely. Second. Any discussion? All those in favor? Aye.
Opposed now. We'll reappoint Mr. Tips. Old Dominion Community Criminal Justice Board, also a three-year term of Mr. Tips.
Ending in, that one ends in 222. This will be a three-year term that extends to 23. How would the board like to handle that one?
Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. Some moved. I hope that Mr. Tips is dressed into a point in a second. Second.
And a second. Any discussion? All those in favor? Aye.
Opposed now. We'll reappoint Mr. Tips. Congratulations, sir. We appreciate your help with that.
We'll bring us to any items. Resounding request 0, 4, 1, 9 for Perry Properties. Mr. Bishop.
Sir, thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. As you noted, this is a rezoning number 0, 4, 1, 9 Perry Properties.
This is an application of rezoned 6.1 acres of a 40, just under 45 acre parcel. Currently zoned to M1, light industrial district to the B2 general district with profits.
The subject property is located on the north side of Millwood Pike Route 50 East at the west side of Constitution Drive.
Partly David Senez and the new FBI facility. If you look at the map to your left, you can pardon the frog in my throat here.
But if you look on the map to your left, you can see the parcel. And we're talking about the blue parcel in the middle of your screen there.
And there once again, it's still the blue parcel in the middle of your screen. And you see the six acres of the 45 acre tract are hashed out. That's the portion of the property we are discussing.
The site is located within the limits of your sense in the eastern urban area plan for the 2035 comprehensive plan and is within your sewer and water service area.
The plan identifies as property within industrial land use designation. As such, it's not the request is not completely within bounds of your comprehensive plan. However, considering the site is bordered by commercially zoned property to the south and the east.
The requested commercial could be acceptable should the board choose to see it that way. Here you can see the plan land uses long range plan land uses for the surrounding area.
With this request, the applicant has proffered a number of improvements to cost Constitution Boulevard and Route 50, which includes the following to improve the southbound travel lanes, which is a widening that's taken place because those aren't your typical full with 12 foot lanes.
They're going to widen those out to the full 12 foot lane lanes. Dedication of right away and associated easements with that improvement. Construction of a full access access commercial entrance on Constitution at the back of the property.
Right in right out on Route 50, they're going to construct a right turn lane into that right in right out. And they're also going to be dedicating right away along Route 50 to accommodate the future six lane section.
As well as a 10 foot asphalt path or along Route 50 and along Constitutional along the frontage of the property.
In addition, the owner is going to submit traffic studies as needed when they according to the ITE trip generation manual exceed with the new development they would put on 3000 trips.
The reason for that is that the TIAs that were recently done out there with Navy Federal and FBI assume 3000 trips from this property.
So they're simply stating that if they go to exceed that, that they would study that and make the associated improvements.
So in addition, they will be requiring all site plans for parcels within the B2 district portion of the property that have Millwood frontage to provide landscaping that's actually in addition to the zoning ordinance as shown on the Prophet exhibit, which is coming up here.
And finally also a monetary, monetary contribution of 10 cents per building square foot for fire and rescue services.
We have the noted improvements, drawings that are attached to your proffers.
You have the right away desiccation. If I zoom really in tight here, you can't see that enhanced landscape enhancement area.
That's right just north of the asphalt trail. And of course you also see the additional right turn lane area and right away to accommodate the future widening of Route 50 itself.
The planning commission did review this on December 4th and recommend approval following the required public hearing staff is seeking a decision from the board as you see fit.
I can take any questions you may have.
Questions of Mr. Bishop. Anyone?
Mr. President.
I had a call on Mr. Lawrence, but the sewage issue is not an issue.
And he makes a comment in the general on approaching capacity. So is that going to become an issue or not?
My understanding is that that is not going to be an issue.
So if this goes through, we do not have a problem that area.
I mean, I'm pinching a little bit for Kansas to see me. I apologize for that, but no, my understands that that is no longer an outstanding issue.
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Others? Questions of Mr. Bishop, anyone?
All right, sir.
Anyone representing this?
I do apologize. We do have Mr. Evan White here representing the applicant.
Mr. White, sir, welcome.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Members of the board, happy new year.
I'm Evan White with Greenway Engineering, representing the commercial resounding application.
To expand a little bit on John's presentation, as I'm sure the board knows, VDOT just recently finished a significant improvement project at the Independence Constitution 50 intersection.
And so that with along with the employment uses that have recently developed Navy Federal expanding their campus FBI record center.
Obviously, this corner now wants to have some commercial component to it.
And so that's why we're here before you this evening.
What we did with the transportation proffers, as John mentioned, VDOT and Navy Federal did a traffic study.
They assumed a certain amount of traffic generation from this undeveloped property.
So we included that and the assumptions for what we were going to do.
And then what we did with the proffer, we said whenever a site plan comes in, we'll use VDOT's projected traffic accounts for that specific land use.
If it exceeds the threshold that was done in the initial study, we would then at the site plan stage determine if there were additional improvements needed to that corridor area.
That could be maybe expanding the left turn stacking capacity or something like that.
And the way the proffer is written, that would be determined with the site plan and the improvements would be performed with that site plan so it gets done all at once.
So that's the only thing I would like to add to that.
And then Mr. Dundier question, sewage capacity is available.
There is a pump station at Navy Federal Credit Union that does have some limited capacity.
So that would need to be analyzed as use has become known and then upgrades to the pump station if necessary.
And we've coordinated that with freighter water.
Sir, are we having a cup? Why don't we let him finish and come back?
That's really all I had to have, but I'll certainly be happy to answer any questions.
No, I would like to ask.
So if you have to have an upgrade, is that going to be paid for by Frederick Water? Is that paid for by the applicant?
So what Frederick Water does is once a utility is constructed, they own and operate it.
It has a certain amount of capacity.
If that capacity gets close to being at capacity or exceeds capacity in order for them to allow for the property to get a tap fee for the water or sewer, they have to do the associated improvements to make the utility work correctly.
So the payment is borne by the developer and not by Frederick Water.
Okay, and as I said, I kind of call him Mr. Lawrence, but I have a chance to chat with him.
So if you go over that capacity at some future point in time, which is asking us a question, then the applicant will go and address that issue.
Is that correct?
That's correct. It's not really anything with the transmission system. It's the amount of capacity the pump station would have.
So that's really what would be analyzed.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. White.
Other questions of Mr. White, anyone?
All right, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is a public hearing. Would anyone like to comment concerning this application, this rezoning application, anyone at all?
Anyone?
Let us call.
Seeing no one will close the public comment portion.
I would like to handle this request.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Provider-Fisher.
I believe this would be a welcome asset commercially to this area of the county.
So therefore I would move for approval of rezoning 0, 4-19 for the Perry Properties LLC with proffers.
I've heard the motion is our second.
Second.
And the second.
Is there any discussion?
Anyone?
Mr. Provider-Fisher.
Aye.
Mr. Provider-McCarthey.
Aye.
Mr. Provider-Slogger.
Aye.
Mr. Provider-Wells.
Aye.
Mr. Provider-Dunne.
Aye.
Mr. Provider-Graver.
Aye.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
The rezoning is approved.
That will bring us to 12B, ordinance amendment.
County Code.
Klein.
Yes, good evening, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the Board of Supervisors.
This is an ordinance amendment public hearing regarding public utilities.
Those of you who are on the board in 2019 will recall.
The Board of Supervisors, after holding your public hearing on November the 13th, requested
that utility scale solar power generating facilities be revised to a conditional use in the
RA, rural areas zoning district.
So this proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance adds a definition for public utilities.
A definition for utility scale power generating facilities and also a definition for decommissioning.
We've also added additional regulations for specific uses that requires utility scale solar power
generating facilities to make arrangements, including financial security for decommissioning,
that's consistent with and as required by the code of Virginia.
And also that those types of facilities require a site plan review and approval.
And that's specifically the change that's come since November the 13th was that we will require utility
scale solar power generating facilities as a conditional use in the RA zoning district.
The intent of this text amendment is to codify utility scale solar power generating facilities as an
allowed use with an approved conditional use permit and to codify recent changes to the code of
Virginia to include decommissioning of solar energy facilities.
The text amendment also cleans up terminology throughout the zoning ordinance for public utilities.
And the text amendment does not amend requirements for other types of public utilities,
including those facilities owned and operated by Frederick water.
The development review and regulations committee or DRRC discussed this item and supported the proposed changes.
This item was discussed by the planning commission on September 4 and the Board of Supervisors on September the 25th.
That that meeting the Board requested additional definitions for solar and for decommissioning which were included.
The planning commission held a public hearing on October 16 and recommended approval at that time of utility scale solar power generated
facilities as a by right use under the allowance for public utilities.
Following that meeting the Board held a public hearing on November the 13th as stated earlier.
And you in this body sought that utility scale solar facilities be added as a conditional use in the RA district,
which is again the amendment before you this evening.
The planning commission held a public hearing on this revised amendment on December the 18th.
And at that meeting the planning commission recommended denial of the proposed change to include utility scale solar power generating facilities as a conditional use in the RA district.
Following the public hearing this evening staff is seeking action by the Board on this proposed zoning ordinance text amendment.
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you.
Questions of Mr. Klein. Anyone? Anyone?
Thank you, sir. This is a public hearing. Would anyone like to comment concerning this proposed ordinance amendment?
Anyone at all? Anyone? Last call? No one will close the public comment portion of the discussion.
Mr. Chairman, how would you like to handle this one? Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. I would you move forward to option of the ordinance amendment as presented.
As presented? Yes, sir. As a conditional use permit. Yes, sir.
All right. Thank you. For this motion is there a second? Second, Mr. Chairman.
And a second. Is there any further discussion? The supervisor died.
Mr. Chairman, I should have asked staff. But when they talk about the decommissioning, there's money going to be there for that decommissioning 20 years later in the dollars that are necessary.
At that time. So for example, because $1,000 to date a decommission, 20 years from now, that $1,000 bond will not cover that.
So is there a allowance to allow for a full cost of the decommissioning when it occurs?
It's time. It's unusual, but let's have you answer the question.
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.
I don't know if I have the answer off the top of my head looking to Mr. Chair and who typically handles the bonding for the county.
But I believe the bond covers it at the time that its bond is agreed to, not the future value.
But as part of the estimation is now covers that full value.
So the text, Mr. Klein, talks about covering the value for decommissioning.
I'm just asking this question. Can that cost of decommissioning be an estimate of what that cost will be when that decommissioning occurs 20 years out, 30 years out,
which then accounts for the time value of money?
It's an estimation. It's not it up.
I know it's not it to the penny, but they will do it in the estimated cost down in the future as opposed to the estimated cost today.
They're looking at the value of the facilities at the time of installation, but also looking ahead to include the future value.
Mr. Ruddy would like to comment as well.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. Similar to the discussion we had at the last time, the state code in addressing the decommissioning provides us the ability to add annual inflation factors.
So when we're creating and working on what that bond amount may well be, we can certainly take an appropriate inflationary factor into account.
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good. Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Ruddy. Further discussion?
One. Are we ready?
We also said with rezoning 02-03, which was for the Winchester Medical Center.
The property is located on the map to your left.
And of course, it's just west of Route 37 north of existing Route 50.
It's in the Gainesburg, Magisterio district.
The approved Generalized Development Plan, which was done in 2003, labeled very specific uses and very specific areas on the Generalized Development Plan.
and it is that which the applicant is looking to change to provide more flexibility with
the development of their project. There is the removal of minor profit three which deals
with a landscape roundabout feature that was not incorporated into the design of the project.
And the applicant has already also added a reference to the Commonwealth Transportation
Board's action with regards to Future Route 37 and their access to the new interchange
that was placed on the property. So again minor modifications to the recently previously
approved rezoning. The generalized development plan that is on the screen to your left which
was part of your agenda of course is the new generalized development plan and hopefully
that identifies the area of the B2 commercial uses and the MS which is the medical support
district uses and again it identifies the general location of the roads serving this project.
I will point out as we did at the planning commission a note that is added to the generalized
development plan highlighted on the screen in the top left corner which ensures that entrances
to the commercial area immediately west of this property shall be granted by Winchester
Medical Centre through the development of this property. I point that out again because
it's something that's been reinforced through the subdivision plans the master plan with
Winchester Medical and again with this project to ensure that that connection for what is
the botanical square rezoning that was done by the board in 2008 is provided. Again relatively
minor changes to the profile excuse me the profit generalized development plan and the
profit is associated with this request. As it is a minor profit amendment public hearings
not required the planning commission that they're meeting on December the 18th recommended approval
of this request and following the discussion of the board we're looking for an an action from
the board of supervisors be happy to answer any questions that the board may have and Mr. Michael
is here representing the valley engineering and the application at this time if you have any
questions of him. I answer questions of Mr. Ruddy anyone I do can you further describe the
manner text revisions as it proposes to update the internal street network.
I can totally try to if we will go back to the generalized development plan this is the original
generalized development plan that was provided with the 2003 rezoning and you can see what they were
actually I should try and annotate this if I may and again we have botanical drive which is in this location
excuse me botanical drive runs in this general location with the private street coming off
here going through their project through or to the card as it exists excuse me as it was with
the original rezoning it stopped short of the adjacent property at the time in 2003 there was no
interchange and visioned or approved by the Commonwealth Transportation Board so that was how
it provided access to that property subsequent to the 2003 rezoning the hospital obtained approval
and developed constructed the interchange in that location and so with that I will go back here if I
may excuse me cancel these things and recognize the new generalized development plan which is
relatively similar if I may again try and annotate as we go botanical as it exists in this location
through the property provides the framework if you will for the road this is a private road
connection very similar to the one that was done on the original rezoning request and what you will
see here is a connection to the interchange that was put in against subsequent to the original
rezoning there is a note in the proper statement that was requested by VDOT to reinforce that that
is not a full access point that that is very limited by the resolution that was done by the
Commonwealth Transportation Board so while this revised layout shows that connection the connection
is limited in scope answer my question thank you sir thank you are the questions of Mr. Ruddy
anyone thank you sir anything you'd like to answer
good evening I'm Daniel Michael with Valley Engineering just a couple comments
when this whole thing came up and we start working with the county staff they've been great to
work with a lot of people stand up here and complain and clap your hands they've been they've
been wonderful back to the original each of the original master plan that was approved
and on the front page of that there was a square box and it said Proffers you know all the
text for the Proffers but didn't had that drawing that said a warehouse will go on this specific
spot that's all we're changing we're not trying to change anything else we will work with
the adjacent property owners at the time that there was a if there's an entrance it needs to come
on to botanical across the Valley Health property the only concern that Valley Health's ever had
is we are limited to 14,000 trips per day from the 104 acres that was originally resumed
and we just don't want any confusion that says all right if we give somebody else access the
cross of Valley Health property that had originally 104 acres that it impacts our traffic study
that's the only concern that we have and I think we can work with staff and get through that
I don't have any issues with what they've done and I appreciate what they've done
Does anybody else have any questions?
Any other questions? Supervisor MacArthur? Thank you for sure
You had mentioned that the hospital would work with the adjoining landowners and at the
end you brought up the matter of the traffic study in my conversations with staff and the county
attorney I was assured that any traffic coming off of those other parcels not owned by the hospital
would not impact those numbers so that being said you have a note on the generalized plan of
development that says that entrance to botanical boulevard entrance to commercial use areas shall
be granted by Winchester Medical Center and you've just mentioned that you will work with them
so is this just a you shall have the right to access or is there going to be some discussion
between Winchester Medical Center on what constitutes your right to have access at some point in the
future? I don't think there's any kidney conversations on where it's going back and forth but we
want an entrance where you can't have one it's not going to be that it's going to be the Virginia
Department of Transportation has very specific guidelines if you look at you we have around 50
and then we have we go up that first call to sack on the drawing so you only have so much
distance in there there's be not requirements as how far I have to be away from those intersections
before I can put another entrance in that will determine where the entrance goes
so you have a notation on the generalized plan of development but there's no actual
verbiage in the proper itself directly to that point would your client have any opposition to
having specific language in the proffers reiterating that point? Was it covered in the
proffers? We could check that I have I have no issue the what I would ask is the generalized
plan of development is that part of the proffers? It is but isn't some jurisdictions and that's
why I'm asking? I understand it is that it is but my concern is you know it says very clearly that
access shall be granted but you've stated that they would work with Winchester Medical Center
some trying to figure out what are they working on with Winchester Medical Center? Like we would
work with them to go back through to v dot and say all right you know they can't they couldn't
come and say all right I want to go in 150 feet in off of route 50 and put an entrance in
we would work with them but you can't put one there and I get to be further away by v dot standards
I guess I would feel better about this proffer if we had specific language in the proffer statement
itself that specifically said that these folks shall have access granted within certainly the
realm of v dot's requirements but that they shall have that reiterated I would feel a little bit
better knowing that that that your client actually means what it says there by putting that into
that statement so that would be it will in their part to show yes we do mean that we shall give
them that if they put it in the proffer statement itself I would say that you know I could get behind
something like this okay super resident um first of all I'd like to go and reiterate what
supervisor McCarthy said in the proffer statement you have before us it says um that the interchange
talking about the ice 73750 interchange when traffic generation from 102 acre site exceeds 14,000
you know TBD and I've had a conversation with staff today long meeting and their interpretation of
that is that affects only the traffic that's generated by the medical center it does not generate
anything on any adjacent landowner etc is that your interpretation as well and just let me
phrase this does the applicant agree that that is the interpretation has stated here in the proffer
but I just think but I've heard verbally a different comment from your attorney so that's why
I'm asking the question it says that 102 acres site which is the original 102 acres site and at 14,000
trips per day the concern that we had was it says from it refers back to the original outline of
that parcel so if adjacent property owner comes in and crosses if they if they purchase some
property from valley health to put their entrance in is that made does that little sliver land
constitute traffic from property that was was is bound by the 14,000 trips per day and that's
what they were saying no we can our staff believes that traffic from adjacent properties does not
affect the 14,000 trips per day and that's perfect that's wonderful and I want to make certain
though that your client agrees that that is the case with verbally I've been told that your client
has said that it does so we're trying to have a clear understanding of what is it is not that 14,000
and talking to staff today and they can make big big their own comments if they so choose that
that 14,000 is only only for traffic that is generated on that property not on any other adjacent
property okay then then we are in agreement with that and just so you know we're working on a
site plan right now for a large building over on that west campus and I actually did it myself
today we have the ambulatory surgery center over there we have the the hotel and the building
that we're proposing and I worked on the thing that's going to go on our site plan and we're going
to call it a trip generation summary and I use the IT manual and I said this is the hotel the hotel
over there has 136 rooms they generate I forget 800 and some trips per day we have the
the ambulatory surgery center it generates this many our use that we're going to be submitting
on in the near future generates this many that came in just under 3000 trips per day
so it's it's the site plans we're going to show we're allowed 14 and we're up to 3000 now
and by and by the same token as mr. McCarthy stated there is a a buffer zone yes from root 50
going north which is on the westhand side of botanical so your client is agreeing in this
program just to ask the question that a entrance can be done with no further approval by your client
that they can have an entrance as it stayed in the property I think it's one entrance into the
adjacent landowners going north on botanical correct yes all right thank you mr. Sherman
supervisor just to clarify something you mentioned something that sort of
picked my my interest you'd mentioned if someone were to purchase an entrance onto botanical
from Winchester Medical Center this says that it should be granted not that it shall be sold
is it the intention of Winchester Medical Center to sell an entrance or access point to
an adjacent landowner or is it their intention to grant access across their property to botanical
all right away in other words yeah I don't know okay I'm just being honest I could say from the
people I know there the people I've worked with if if the adjacent owner convinced that we want
to put an entrance here and you need to give the land you know a 50 foot wide strip for a right
away if I was in the meetings with them I would say just give a tool thank you other questions
anyone thank you sir thank you all right we kind of got all cracked so we were in discussion
taken motion to approve mr. McCarthy
hi mr. Sherman I would ask that we postpone this discussion to get an answer to my question with
regard to whether the hospital intends to sell an access or grant an access and the reason I say
that is I think there's a lot of leverage that can be wielded with this idea of it says here
we proper that we will grant access but if it's to be sold I could say pay me two billion dollars
and I will give you the access I promise to grant so I think there's a lot of too much wiggle room
there a lot of power that can be wielded against the property owners that are adjacent so I'm not
comfortable moving forward with this proper amendment and so we get that aspect of it worked out
okay so your proposing my motion is to postpone your motion to amend is to postpone
did we have a motion we don't have a motion yesterday we were in discussions no we were in the
public hearing aspect of our opinion I don't think there was motion you're still in the public hearing
portion no public hearing you were in discussion yeah I think yeah but no motion at the
there's no motion close to public hearing but there's been no motion
according to the court you what it doesn't require a public hearing
I might as well have to speak up because there was not there was not a public hearing
mr chairman I'm sorry there was not a public hearing for this item it's it was a matter of
proper revision so there was no public we had not held the public hearing right there was no
requirement alone one but there is no motion yet on the four-mile motion was the first motion
okay all right is everybody okay and comfortable with that that is where we ended up all right
so I'll take the blame for that one we do we have a motion to postpone for a period of time a
second I would postpone until we get an answer to that question presented to staff I think we
be better off to give them a time frame the next board of supervisors meeting so I'm going to be
enough could you just state your my motion is to postpone any action on this matter until we get
an answer to the question of is Valley Health Winchester Medical Center granting access without
any type of remuneration and without any other further oversight of what the development would
be on the adjacent properties or are they anticipating asking for some type of consideration and return
for the grant of access to the property until we get an answer to that question I'd like to postpone
action on this and a second you mentioned the next meeting to the next meeting do you intend
to include that in your matter okay you're comfortable that that was his intention in gentleman
you comfortable with the next meeting thank you sir further discussion anyone this is not
a public hearing no it's a minor amendment so there was no okay that's a reason okay well good
with that all right for all finished motion is to postpone until the next meeting until we get
an answer that's about me good we're going to vote so supervisor Graber hi supervisor done hi
supervisor Wells supervisor slaughter hi supervisor McCarthy supervisor Fisher hi
chair votes I in the motion carries all right ordinance amendment the Frederick County Code
we just did that 11b
do you deal with that one you board liaison reports I'm sorry do what
you're 14 days on reports okay that's hot thought okay board liaison reports are there any
I think committees have met for a while any board liaison reports seeing none one will pass
the suppression of the meeting reserve for citizen comments on any issue whatsoever that you'd like
to bring to the board's attention we'd like to speak on any issue one yes sir if you would if we
could have your name magisterial district and attempt to limit your comments to three minutes or
less please sir John Owens from back creek district I just want to call your attention to
something that's going to be coming before you in the next couple weeks and that has to do with
sale communication tires by right of what 100 feet or more in RA districts I think you need to
look at that carefully it seems that you could put up a tire right now and call with a ham
operator's tire no problem but there's nothing seeing that he can't go ahead and put on something
for internet on that tire which you know you're getting you're putting a cart before the horse
I think the planning commission needs to look at this this way companies getting around
the zoning that they need to look at if you live in a residential district or in an RA and you could
have every house could have a 50 foot 100 foot ham operator's tire I don't think you want that
that wasn't the purpose of moving out there in the first plate to see all these tires
they also have the right once the tires up they can attach whatever equipment they need for
internet there's nothing you can do about it so I think that's something you need to look at
where these tires are and exactly what they can attach to them if they apply for a ham operator
that's fine but not attaching all of your internet stuff from other companies thank you thank you
sir anyone else like to comment anyone seeing that one will close the public comment portion or
to supervisors comments are there any supervisor great Mr. Chairman thank you I would just like to
reiterate I'm a I'm a little disappointed with how the rules and things were distributed here
at the beginning of the meeting as far as the adoption of rules and procedures I'm a little
disappointed that there were not discussions and in the input into the development of those
rules prior to them being proposed and some of the rules in which were outlined I believe would
severely restrict the ability of our citizens to address their elected members of this board so
I'm very thankful that this board voted tonight as they did to strike out all that that is in
red and I am very disappointed in all who had a hand in presenting the rules and procedures that
we did vote on this evening thank you thank you sir anyone else anyone to all supervise MacArthur
I'd just like to say how thankful I am to have supervisor Fisher sitting here next to me I think
it's a great grant to step up and step into this role and that's good to see that
appreciate you saving the taxpayers money by bringing back your name plaque
yes much appreciated anyone else comments vice chairman wells this chairman I move we adjourn
are you to adjourn second second all those in favor are all right thank you appreciate
everyone's time and attendance
