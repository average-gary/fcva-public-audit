i'r D.E.Q.
I'r P.B.R. is a state level administrative review and approval process for the sighting
of solar facilities in the Commonwealth and that includes an extensive environmental
and cultural review and study.
One component of the state required P.B.R. review is local jurisdictional approval
of solar project sighting and this conditional use permit application if approved by Frederick
County would otherwise satisfy the requirements enabling the completion of the P.B.R.
process for this project.
So should the Planning Commission find this used to be appropriate staff has recommended
that the following conditions of approval be included that the review of all agency
comments provided during the review of this application should be complied with it
all times that an engineered sight plan and accordance with the requirements of article
eight of the Frederick County zoning ordinance shall be submitted to and subject to approval
by Frederick County prior to the establishment of the use.
The sight plan shall address the additional regulations for specific uses contained in
section 165-204-26 of the Frederick County zoning ordinance and should be in general
conformance with the preliminary sight plans included with the CUP application that
was prepared by the Timmons group and has dated April 17th 2020.
Further buffers and screenings shall be provided around the perimeter of the project in general
conformance with the quantity of the proposed plantings depicted on sheet five of the
preliminary sight plan the landscape vegetative screening detail which is included with the
CUP application and it was prepared by the Timmons group dated April 17th 2020 and that the
buffers and screenings shall be should fulfill the landscape screening requirements contained in
section 165-203-02B1 of the Frederick County zoning ordinance.
Number four prior to sight plan approval the owner shall enter into a written agreement with
Frederick County for the decommissioning of solar energy facilities or devices person to the
terms and conditions of section 15.2-2241.2B of the code of Virginia and that the written
agreement shall be updated every five years in general conformance with the decommissioning plan
included with the CUP application prepared by Walsh, Kluci, Lubli and Walsh revised April 21st 2020
that batteries for the purpose of storage of electricity that will eventually be transferred
to the grid are prohibited as part of the CUP application and that any expansion or modification
of this land use would require the approval of a new conditional use permit. Following the
public hearing this evening staff is seeking a recommendation from the planning commission to
forward to the board of supervisors on this proposed conditional use permit for utility scale
solar power generating facility and that any recommendation for approval from the planning
commission should also include a statement affirming that the proposed solar facility is in
substantial accord with the comprehensive plan. Again referencing the conditions of approval
you have your sight plan that was included with the application which was cited in the conditions
of approval for general conformance which includes a landscape screening detail and your decommissioning
plan which was cited in condition number four which includes the details of returning the
site to the pre-development condition should this facility become obsolete. I'm happy to answer any
questions you would have and the applicant represented by John foot is here this evening and also
Robert probes with urban grid is here as well to answer any questions. Thank you. Thank you Mr.
Klein any questions for Mr. Klein? I want Mr. Rhodes. Why is batteries prohibited? They're
they're not part of their project they don't intend to have any batteries for the purposes of
mass storage. We have seen from some of the discussion from the neighbors some concerns about
the use of batteries and potential for our environmental impacts and batteries on site so the
applicant has agreed to prohibit that as it's not part of their operation of a solar facility.
I would confirm for you all that there are batteries proposed that are only used for tracking of
the panels to ensure that they return to the right position when the sunset so that they're ready
to go the next the next morning but there's no batteries for the purposes of mass storage.
All right the other questions. Seeing none thank you Mr. Klein. I will add you all were provided
all of the written comments that have been received by staff you all have been provided answers
to questions that Mr. Jewel compiled on behalf of the neighbors from the applicant and you've
been provided several other supplemental materials from the applicant and support their application
I just want to make that clear as part of the record. We have one question. Yes sir.
CUP applies to the entire 600 acre parcel 600 plus acres they're going to put solar panels on
380 acres so if they would if they would at some point want to put additional solar panels so
they would have to come back. Yes sir that is that is correct that is the conditional use permit.
That would be correct because condition number three specifies conformance general conformance
with the site plan and the site plan contains 370 acres of solar panels so they would need to be
they would to amend that plan that's part of the conditions they would have to come back
through this CUP process that is correct. Thank you. In the applicant would like to come forward
please. Good evening. Members of the commission it's good to be back with you it's been a
while since I've been here I've been for the last 30 years in front of you on projects of
any number of types but tonight I'm back before you and a project has never been here before
the commission or in the county that said I know that there are a number of you on the commission
who actually know a good deal about solar power and so you're not going to need to be taught
everything that you need to know about solar because you probably don't write much about it.
That said I want to put it in real context a little bit and to say that Virginia has adopted
a very aggressive energy policy and that energy policy among other things tells the two major
energy suppliers emerging a dimension power an appellation power the about 2045 in the case of
dominion in 2050 in the case of appellation that they have to get rid of their fossil fuel systems
they must be on renewables or clean energy now conversations that I've had with others of course
mean the natural gas is not going to go away anytime soon but the fossil fuels that we think of
coal for example has to be gotten rid of by that time where you're going to get the other sources
and it's going to be renewable sources like wind and solar urban grid obviously seeks to be a part
of that process but it only seeks to be a part of that process in a manner that's acceptable
to Frederick County that's why in the process that we've been going through with Tyler and Candice
and Mike they we have prepared what we think you will find to be a very thorough application with
respect to this case there have been much coordination with the staff much discussion between
and but Twix does all about an application I want to introduce to you if I can James Crawford wave
James James is the guy we all we all answer to it urban grid back there Rob probes you'll hear from
in just a second Bri Herberline back there is another LSU grad just so you know
and our engineer but speaking of engineers we also have with us Dan Jamison and Julia campus
from Timmans who can answer any technical questions you may have since you're not going to be
asking me Roger any technical questions you had to promise me that are you Larry either one of you
we're here to make a brief presentation with respect to urban grid and to the solar project
and also to answer any questions that you may have and so with that brief introduction I'd like to
introduce to you Robert Cropes who will take over from here Cropes
but evening chairman Kenny members of the planning commission staff and citizens of Frederick County
my name is Rob probes and I am a development manager with urban grid I'm excited excited to
be with you tonight to share some information about an exciting economic development opportunity
for Frederick County so often when a commercial development is presented to you they're trade-offs
between the economic growth offered by the new business and the impacts to the county services
and infrastructure the solar project that I will be discussing with you tonight requires
no new county infrastructure and no additional county services yet it provides long-term
predictable revenue for the county while helping local farmers diversify their farm income
and at the end of its useful life the system will be removed and the land could be restored
to agriculture I can think of no other development project that offers these benefits
some of the slides you'll see I Tyler did such an amazing job of covering the project so well
I'll probably just gloss over so not so you don't have a repeat of what has already been shared
but first let me start off by talking a little bit about urban grid who we are as a company
urban grid is a leading developer of utility scale solar power plants in the mid-Atlantic
United States we deliver projects that are vital source of clean renewable energy
we are founded in Richmond, Virginia in 2011 and we have offices in Richmond,
Washington DC and Stevensonville, Maryland the company has over 290 megawatts of operating
solar projects in primarily the mid-Atlantic as well as the UK we have over 7100 megawatts
of solar projects in our development pipeline across nine states and we have a proven
track record of delivering quality projects these are just a sampling of some of the projects
that are in Virginia in various stages of development
this is slide I typically have in there when I'm delivering a presentation to communities
I know it's a little bit basic but simply put panels absorb the sunlight
they turn DC energy into AC energy it gets transmitted to electrical grid
and that energy is consumed by homes and businesses
I'm often asked how we identify the sites that make sense for solar the site identification process
so really we start by looking at places where there's a robust interconnection to put
electricity onto electrical grid and when we find that we start looking for land that might be
suitable and you know land that is open space primarily it's few wetlands and preferably not
a lot of topography and then we start to reach out to the landowners to see if they have an
interest in either leasing us some land or purchasing us purchasing the land and then if they
are interested then we'll start a very long interconnection process in this part of the country
the entity that we work with is called PJM and they are the essentially a grid manager
and we go through about a two and a half year study process with them where they evaluate the
impact of the project on the electrical grid and then determine what impacts and any costs
associated with those impacts that we would have to bear and then of course zoning and site
permits convincing construction and then operating it at the heart of the project are our landowners
without them we wouldn't have a project so as I mentioned in this part of the country and it's true
in the Voxclub Solar Project we're interconnecting through PJM, PJM manages an extensive electrical
grid network spanning multiple states so what that allows us to do is inject energy at a place in
the grid but it could be purchased wholesale throughout the entire region that PJM manages that
entire grid. This completed project would be owned and operated by utility or an independent
power producer. The Voxclub Solar Project will diversify regional energy generation sources
which helps the Commonwealth's mandates as John spoke about previously and it significantly
reduces carbon pollution in the region. I won't belabor this slide I think Tyler just did
an amazing job already of telling you exactly where the project is located the amount of buildable
areas that we're talking about the size of it. I'll just touch on the timing a construction
anticipated to begin in 2021 with completion in early 2022.
Tyler also talked a little bit about the permit by rural process or PBBR that the Virginia
Department of Environmental Quality developed for projects that are they consider smaller projects
that's 150 megawatts or less and as Tyler really already mentioned it does not in any way replace
the local permitting process rather as I like to say it serves as a belt and suspenders to
permitting solar projects under 150 megawatts. The PBBR process evaluates the environmental
cultural and land use impacts and it requires coordination with several state agencies.
In the end of a five to six month process DEQ will require project developers like us to
mitigate any adverse impacts that we cannot practically avoid. It also provides an additional
opportunity for the public to participate in the review and approval process including a public
meeting in a 30 day public comment period. Just a timeline of the project development
so the CUP application obviously submitted here we are today in June. We can potentially
with the favor of this body and the board of supervisors have an approval sometime late
this summer that will allow us to then go to the PBBR process which I just described and again
that's a five to six month process allowing us to then start construction in the roughly the
second quarter of 2021 and then finalizing in the second quarter 2022 maybe even sooner than that
a lot of times construction timelines are dependent obviously on weather and then of course
operating maintenance and of the facility over what's here about a 35 year period.
This is a slide that you've already seen as well from Tyler. The only thing I'll make mention of
is that Tyler talked a little bit about some of the conceptual construction site access points.
Those are preliminary in nature we've since we've filed the application we've been receiving
some feedback from the community which we're taking under consideration. There's a lot of work
to be done to determine where those construction access points were they were really just very
conceptual in nature when we put them on the map knowing that we just we know we have to have one
or more construction access points but what's really going to impart drive the location of those
access points are the roads and we are going to do a road use analysis with an outside engineering
firm to understand the quality of the roads in the area to serve the project and to be able to safely
deliver goods to the site and we'll once we have that information in hand then we'll go to the
county and v dot share that information with them to get their feedback as well.
Just skip over that these slides here I think Tyler covered these quite well.
This slide here is a visual a view shed analysis that we had done and what what you're seeing
here is the darker blue color is the conceptual layout of the solar panels and then the light blue
striated color are points of reference where you could have a view of the project in year one
when the landscaping is first installed. This analysis took into account the topography
of the area of the area as well and then this is year five so the visual is reduced when that
landscaping is more mature. A little bit about the natural resource management of the project
all existing wetland and stream systems will be completely avoided no panels will be placed
within floodplains the vegetative buffer and the grasses on site will be maintained and managed
for the entire life of the solar project by urban grid. It's going to be our responsibility to
ensure that you know the success of the plantings of the vegetative buffer and to maintain
all native grasses planted post construction that goes above and beyond what the county would
typically require which is a one year maintenance period. A stormwater analysis will be conducted
on site to ensure surface drainage from the project is equal to or less than current drainage.
The project will require an approved stormwater pollution prevention plan by DEQ prior to the
start of construction. A little bit about the cultural resources we have already done what's
called a phase one A analysis of the site to look at the cultural and historic resources.
We've been granted a favorable recommendation by the historic resources advisory board a
couple of weeks ago but I thought I'd just touch on some of the things that we're doing here
to mitigate any adverse impacts to historic resources. Vegetative screening,
it's Tyler I talked about the the trees and the depth of the trees and how that would look
the we'll also we'll use avoidance obviously the site plan includes all property lines and
required setbacks. We'll be avoiding the millage what's known as the millage cemetery with a 50-foot
buffer to preserve that resource and then the cedar creek battlefield the northern extent of
that battlefield encroaches approximately seven acres into the southern portion of one of our
landowners property. We've avoided that completely no panels would be in that northern extent of
the battlefield and I'll just note that the south end of the project area is over two and a half
miles from cedar creek park which is my understanding where some of the dramatizations occur for
civil war reenactments. No panels have been placed on the land as well directly adjacent to the
valley hill winery. If any identified archaeological sites cannot be avoided or minimized adverse
impacts will be mitigated through through archaeological data recovery and we have a team of folks
that will be out there later this month doing the infield what they call phase one surveys for
archaeological. The project construction is estimated to take six to nine months again dependent
on the weather. In terms of construction times the construction would occur between seven a.m. and
seven p.m. Monday through Friday and seven a.m. just to five o'clock p.m. Saturday on Sunday we're
committing to no earth moving equipment be used on Sunday. We would ask that we be allowed to
deliver materials to the site outside of those hours so that heavy haul trucks can make deliveries
when school buses are not on the road or during peak rush hour traffic.
Once the project layout is close to being finalized as I mentioned earlier urban grid would engage
an engineering firm to do a road use analysis and then create a road use plan that will bring back
to the county and dv. to get their input and this will help us to determine the
construction access points and the lay down areas. This slide here it's a little tough to see but
there's three kind of yellow dot stars if you will on the on the eastern site those are
visualization points which will make more sense in the next set of slides. So we took
we did visual simulations or landscape renderings of three different points across the project area
this is the first one Klein's Mill Road this is what it looks like today. This is what it would
look like in year one with the plantings as proposed and this is what it would look like in year five
with the plantings as proposed. This is a Heights Road existing today year one
and year five and then finally this is Valkyrie's Road what it looks like today
year one and year five. So the benefits of solar again no county infrastructure services
required for solar development there's no daily traffic during the operation period no negative
environmental impacts. In fact we'll have less nitrogen discharge than the current farming
operations what I would call a positive green publicity for Frederick County greenhouse gas
reductions and local economic development impact in the form of jobs during construction tax revenue
and local electricity generation. I think some of the couple of letters that you found in your
packet from the staff included businesses that are eager to see this project come to the area
because they see opportunities during the construction period for things like restaurants hotels
that'll be needed and equipment rental and maintenance. Specifically with regard to the economic
impact we did an analysis to take a look at what the real property taxes are based on the current
use in one year if you will versus over a 35-year period and then we also took a look at if the
FoxGov solar project was cited on that same acreage what would the first year of property taxes look
like and over a 35-year period. As you can see pretty dramatic and then of course the personal
property taxes that are generated by the solar facility there's aren't something that
that is currently generated today based on the current use and so we have those taxes that
would be accruing to the county as well. So an estimate just over $3 million over a 35-year
period to the county for real property taxes as well as personal property taxes. Hundreds of
jobs created during the construction of the project and then as I mentioned local business businesses
that benefit during the construction of the project and then also lease payments that get made to
the rural farm families that will inject dollars into the local economy.
This slide really meant to just give you a sense of the amount of electricity, a clean energy
that we were generating it would be the equivalent of powering just over 11,000 homes and offsetting
the CO2 emissions that are equivalent to just over 229,000 barrels of oil or 109 million pounds of
coal. One of the things that we're really proud of as it relates to creating jobs in the common
wealth we're a sponsor of something called the solar hand on instructional network of excellence
or shine. This is a public-private partnership founded by Southside Virginia Community College,
solar developers, construction companies and other tech companies. Essentially their mission is
to develop a workforce for solar developers like Urban Grid and they do this through the solar
ready 101 program and it's a curriculum at the Southside Virginia Community College that individuals
can take and come out and be qualified to work at a solar energy facility. With that, I thank you
for your time tonight. Thank you, sir. It's a good presentation. Thank you. Does anyone have a question
from Mr. Probes? Mr. Thomas? Yes, Mr. Probes. On your decommissioning plan, I noticed in the first
paragraph when you talked about the decommissioning efforts, you talked about concrete foundations.
In the second part of that when you talked about phasing, you had no phase for removal of concrete
foundations, just concrete pads. Now, I noticed on the pictures, it looks like the solar panels are
probably supported on piles or piers. Is there going to be below-grade concrete? Yeah,
those piers? I think that's a great question. The foundations supporting the solar panels
will be just pile-driven HBM. No concrete. There are a scattering of some small concrete pads that
the inverters set on across the project area. I couldn't give you a quantity or account, but
there are just some slabs, maybe four feet by six foot type slabs. That's really the only
concrete that's in use. The below-grade, yes, sir. I also noticed on the view shed pictures you
had, the one you showed for Heights Road, you picked a section a little different than what I was
looking at this afternoon. The first part of Heights Road section, there's a lot of young fruit
trees, apple orchards, are those going to be taken out and removed or you're not going to use
them as part of your buffer? I couldn't speak exactly because I'm not sure where you might be
referencing, but I guess it's the most part of the Heights Road. I will say that if there are some
existing trees that we can take advantage of as buffers, we want to do that. It's far more
cost-effective to keep existing trees in place than to put new landscaping. The landowners have
an ask you to preserve any of the apple orchards or fruit orchards on the site.
I know there's a portion on Heights Road that's adjacent to five or six residential
lots. If that's where you're talking about, it's just south of there. It's the section 0, 3,
84, a 50. I have a board that I'm going to bring up here maybe to help with to determine exactly
what we're talking about. There are residences across from that section.
If you go to Valcluse Road, and you come down Valcluse Road,
note down Heights Road, that section down through there that has on the right side of
whatever that road is here. There's a lot of young orchards in there, and you're not planning
on saving those. So again, I think if we can in a discussion with the planning staff during
the site plan approval, we've put forth a plan that they found acceptable in terms of number of
planning depths of planting. If they were an agreement that that's going to provide an adequate
buffer, then that's something that we would definitely be open to considering leaving those trees
there. But if they believe for some reason that the buffer that we're planning is going to be
more substantial and provide better screening, then we'll obviously commit to that. We're flexible.
I'm not sure apple trees are good for buffers, but I didn't know if the owners wanted to continue
to having the apple trees or not. I think they still have the plans to aerocate with those
renewables. The magnitude of this project is extremely large as far as solar panels.
When you really look at this, it's over 18 million square feet of solar panels, which really
equates to almost 400 football fields of solar panels. So that's a massive amount of solar panels
in an area like that. I noticed your statistics there said that it would power about 11,000 or
over 11,000 homes. Quite honestly, I think we could cover the whole state of Virginia. We couldn't
power a fraction of the state of Virginia's power requirements for solar panels. But I do think
we need solar as one of the diverse power sources. I don't think it's an end all to a panacea
for power sources, but yes, sir. Thank you. Roots. Just about the fruit trees. I added that
no one, a lot of fruit growers have been around them. Last thing they want to see is apple trees
that are staying behind that don't get sprayed regularly because it becomes a breeding ground
for bugs and pests. So if the trees aren't being actually active in orchard, they'd rather see
them pushed out. I didn't know if they wanted to keep those as active or not. They're young,
half of the trees. Well, I imagine they probably wouldn't want the spray material around the solar
panels. Good point. Yeah, valid point for sure. What else? Mr. Tripp? Yes, sir. What key is the
lifespan of this particular project? Yeah, we anticipate the lifespan to be about 35 years.
Yep. The degradation of the efficiency of the panels is only about a half a percent each year.
Pretty robust pieces of technology that require really very little maintenance.
What else? Mr. Jewel? Mr. Prope, thank you. Thanks for all the answers you provided for the
questions from the concerns citizens. The one thing I'm going to encourage you to do
between now and supervisors is the setback is a big discussion with those that live. For example,
what Mr. Thomas talked about, the residents there. You know, when they're asking for the setback
to be pushed back, they're not asking for the entire project setback to be pushed back. But
taking consideration, the residents that are going to be infected and if possible,
we need to add to that to help them. Yes, sir. Thank you.
Forcing. As I appreciate what you've done, a lot of work on it. I do have
several concerns. I'm overall supporting for what you're doing, but looking at the site plan,
which is not final, reminds me of what somebody in Congress said not long ago. We have to pass
the first to find out what's in it. I hope we haven't degraded ourselves to that point,
but that's kind of where we go all the time with these things. But I'm looking at your access points
and all of that and a couple of them really bother me. That row of houses on Heights Road,
you've got an access point right next to the house. You've got a very narrow setback
right adjacent to those houses. I could see construction close to houses, construction traffic.
Once the thing is up and running to traffic is not an issue, but I'm only worried about construction.
I'm thinking it looks like you all did a layout and you scattered out some access points,
but you didn't put into consideration the people who are already there.
So, lay down yards, access points really need to be isolated from existing residents wherever
as is possible. Now, once we pass this, we can bring it back and say, wait a minute, you didn't change
it the way I liked it. I really don't like that, but I guess this is the way the process is.
And my second point is, in your reply to the Senate, you said it substantial
truck plannings around these. Well, substantial is a highly subjective word. What maybe substantial
to you may be terribly inferior to me. And especially where we're going to have some people,
I think planning a little bit heavier is not going to hurt a thing. Like most business people,
you are doing the minimal necessary to meet requirements, but you also stayed at other times,
you want to be a good neighbor in all of this. And I'm not seeing on paper where the good
neighbor parts coming in. You're putting driveways next to houses, you're scattering. At first,
two or three years, the plannings actually have no effect. They're so small, they're immature.
A little bit extra planning would probably be a big help to all of this.
Thank you for your comment. Actually, I'm happy to report that the specific construction
access point that you referenced, we've received similar feedback since putting that in the plan.
We are no longer considering that as a construction access point based on the feedback we received.
Now, appreciate your comments, Valid. We do remain flexible and open to getting these
suggestions. And as I said, I think there's more work on our part to not to finalize the layout,
to do that road use analysis that I talked about. Go back to the county, confer with them,
get their feedback, get the residents feedback before we finalize those points. I appreciate
that. Thank you. Anyone else? Thanks, sir. Anyone else? One question, your presentation
you said it would create hundreds of jobs during the construction period? Yes, sir. Yes, I would
say that at the height of construction, somewhere I'm playing a couple of hundred jobs is not
unrealistic. So you will have that many personnel on the site at that time? During the height of
construction, yes, yes. Or with those couple hundred people park in the in the lay down area.
Okay. Yeah. But a bit of employment. We struggle with school construction with a hundred people
to show us at a time. Well, that's the wonderful thing about solar projects. They do employ a great
number of people and provide good wages as well. Yep. Yes, sir. Mr. Rhodes.
Is anyone else going to be speaking from your group or? No, sir. Well, I had a question about
the site. Are you going to be working with the existing topography? Your plan on doing a lot of
grading out there? Yeah, that's something that we're actually going through that analysis right now.
We've engaged a firm at ECOM to take a look at the layout that we conceptual layout and to help
us to understand how we can do the least amount of grading because grading costs a lot of money.
But yet drive up the energy output. So that that's an analysis we're doing right now. So I couldn't
give you any percentages of grading that we're going to do. I can say that the panels, the panel
technology, the single access trackers that we'll use can tolerate up to about 15 percent slopes.
All right. One of the questions. So what's your financial commitment to a project of this size
and magnitude for urban grid? I mean, are we talking 50 million dollar project or 20 million or?
That's a good question. I'm down on the finance side. I might confer with my VP of development to
get a better answer. So just a second. All right.
This is anticipated to be approximately 101 million dollar investment.
Is that possible? Yeah, one of the questions Mr. Thomas here, please. Is there any reflection or
what are the rays that are reflected back off of the panels? The panels don't absorb all of it.
Are there any what spectrum of rays would be reflected back?
I'm not sure I can answer that in a technical way the way you're asking it. Thanks
a good question. I will say that as you say they are designed to absorb the vast majority of light
to the point where they and there are non-reflective coatings on them.
And these are things that are cited at airports on the shoulders of airports. So
to the extent that they reflect any significant amount of glare that would be an issue for aviation,
which it's not. So I don't necessarily think in glare, but what about heat? Is there any heat radiated
back off? Is there a micro climate developed when we have this amount of solar panels in an area?
Not that I've seen any research to to I've heard that question asked but I have not I've not
seen any research to suggest that there's a a heating of the area because of the solar panels.
I mean yes it's going to be warm over that glass. I don't get me wrong, but in terms of
truly affecting the local climate climate I have not seen any research to support that.
Owners of the property outside of your solar arrays and panels they're not going to use any of
the property at all. I don't know what they're going to do with the excess property. We're
clearly not using all the land that we have under option as you saw from the numbers. I'm not sure
what their plans are. I do know that one of the landers has expressed an interest in some sheep
grazing. So that could be beneficial to to to the project as well as you know so again diversity
of income, but I don't I can't say what their plans will be with the the shoulder portions of
the project. I think maybe grazing some cattle would continue. You have no restrictions outside
of your now you the panels will be fenced. Right anything out there will continue to be their
property. Okay and there there's no restrictions under use of that property. Sir.
The panel technology you're using where does it come from?
A lot of the panels are sourced from Asia. We haven't selected a vendor. It will be a tier
what we consider a tier one vendor. There's also a panel manufacturer in Ohio. That's a possibility
to use their panels, but we haven't selected a vendor too early in the process, but a significant
number of panel manufacturers are outside the United States. They all use the same technology or
yes pretty yeah pretty much so yeah. As a panel deteriorates, does it give off any
pollutants into the soil? No there are no toxic that get washed off in the panels or vapors that
come off or anything like that. No. No it's good questions great great questions. That's okay.
There are other questions. I got one more Mr. Morrison down here looks like of the labor that
you're going to be required to do this. What percentage of that will be labor you bring in for
the project and what percentage do you think would be local labor? Yeah no very question. We always
we so we contract with what's called an EPC or engineering procurement construction
firm to do the actual build of the project. Part of our requirements with them is to source as much
local labor as possible. It's not a hard requirement quite frankly for them to want to meet it
because it makes a lot of sense for them if they're not having to pay for people to stay in
hotels and things like that so it's it makes sense all the way around. We'll have things
there'll be job fairs and announced in advance so yeah we want to have as much local labor as
possible. In no one else raising a hand thank you Mr. Probes. Thank you so much. I appreciate your
time tonight. There's no other questions I will open the public here and at this time I'm sure we
have speakers for this one. We'll do a little transition here from the presentation to get the
citizen comment portal up and running and I think we're ready to go with our first person.
Mr. Bishop will be bringing people in one by one. I think our first person will be Lane
Brunback from from want to understand she would like to speak first and which is quite all right
so if we could be Lane Brunback in.
Members of the planning commission thank you so much for having us here this evening. My name is
Lane Link but the back creep district and I'm here on behalf of Woodbine Farms along with my father
Harmon Brunback. We are here today to discuss with you our objectives in collaborating with urban
grade regarding the construction of a solar farm. Our family began farming in 1898 on 280 acres
of land. For many years of hard work in the contributions of six generations of family members
we now farm 1400 acres of land in Frederick County. We work hard and take pride in providing the
community with fresh local produce. We love this community and want to see it continue to flourish
and prosper. The construction of the solar facility would help our farm to continue to thrive
as a farming business a business that has represented the backbone of this area. Unfortunately
over the course of the last five years we have seen a steady decline in market prices in all
commodities. We do not see these prices improving in the foreseeable future. The uncertainty created
with the current COVID-19 health crisis also puts agriculture and jeopardy. We worry that with
market prices not improving cost of living increasing and the new uncertainty created by the
pandemic we would need to downsize by selling land to offset these factors. Through thoughtful
review of our options we believe solar farming to be the one least adverse to our community.
It would also keep our land out of land development and housing. Over the past several years we have
seen an increase in housing development in this area and it's something we hope to avoid. A solar
farm would be our best option in maintaining the peacefulness and integrity of the natural landscape.
We love the land and have been farming the majority of this proposed property since the 1930s.
Installing the solar field would allow us to maintain ownership of the property while leasing
it for the duration of the project. Areas of this land on this farm property not being used to
generate electricity would continue to remain an agricultural use. There are also innovative
innovative agricultural options available within the solar panel area that allow for multiple
agricultural enterprises. Some of these options include grazing sheep, pollinator habitats and
honeybee aviaries. We have been in contact with a North Carolina State Extension specialist
about grazing sheep around the panels. Sheep grazing and solar facilities has been done
successfully as a way to maintain the vegetation around the panels without extensive mowing or
herbicide treatment. The use of sheep continues the agricultural aesthetics of the land.
The Virginia pollinator smart program would allow us the opportunity to raise honeybee's
and plant pollinator blocks on the land around the panels. We are currently establishing a
pollinator block on our farm. Initiatives like these would allow us to keep this land an agricultural
use. The construction of the solar farm would also provide clean energy to the power grid.
It is a safe and renewable way to generate energy. We are excited for the opportunity to help
facilitate this for the area. We sincerely appreciate your consideration of our proposal and
hopefully have provided you with insight on why we feel the censure would be in the best interest
for our family, neighbors and project county. We take great pride in being a part of this wonderful
community. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.
Anyone else like to come before the commission and speak this time?
I will add why they're ready to come that we use. We have a three minute limit. We'll be
as lenient as possible tonight, but we usually have a three minute limit for public hearing speaking.
My name is Paul Anderson. My wife and I marry our land owners in the back creek district.
We operate about 250 acres of land. All that land is in back creek. This particular piece of
property that I'm concerned with is 50 acres. It's in a trust with my wife and her sister.
I'm very glad to see you guys go in and tell you the truth. At the agriculture, I'm a supportive
agriculture. I like to see the county do everything they can to reserve agriculture. There's two
options on this. One option is something like this for putting houses. With houses, they're there
forever. You'll never have an opportunity to take them out. I really encourage you all to take
a close look at this. People are going to be upset with it because it doesn't look good or anything
like that. But as far as I'm concerned, it's the best use to land. It's a lot better than houses.
I wish they'd went across the fence about 50 feet and used my property. I encourage you to
support it. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
Hello. My name is Danielle and I am here to address the proposed solar panel. The first thing
I would like to say is that I feel like this project is trying to be pushed through during a pandemic
and that is not right. Many people in this county are not aware of this project. Does that
treat this? Not only are they not aware, but the people who are aware are scared to leave their
homes to address their concerns on the issue. Yes, I know you have tried to accommodate this,
but we all know it's not the same. A lot of people do not know how know that they can or know how
to submit e-commerce and how to go about voicing their opinions and writing and where to send it.
On the virtual call, Urban Grid hosted, I asked how will this directly benefit me? The response
was your taxes will drastically be reduced. I am asking the county now if this is true. From
the numbers I have been provided of what the county will be receiving and dividing that into
current population, I will be receiving two dollars off my tax. So I ask you tonight, how will
this benefit me and what kind of tax breaks are you looking at me receiving from this?
Urban Grid has also presented the fact that this will increase jobs in Frederick County.
The construction is only one year long with minimal maintenance afterwards. Urban Grid set
themselves, Moena's a grass which is done two to three times per year depending on weather.
How is that increasing jobs? What happens to those jobs after one year? I have also been told
that the power would be sold to local power companies. What happens to the power companies who buy
this power? How does it affect the number of employees those companies need? In my opinion,
increasing jobs seems like it's only a temporary benefit for the county. I have actually done a lot
of research on solar farms. Research on solar farms across the country show that these projects
are the cause of erosion and flooding on neighboring land. When I directly asked Urban Grid about this,
I was informed that there will be less flooding. By removing trees and excavating the land,
flooding is going to be a severe consequence. Making the flooding we already deal with worse.
While it is a part of nature making it worse for this rural community is not an option.
Does Urban Grid plan to build a retention pond at the edge of the properties to prevent this?
Because that brings about a whole need set of issues. With over 600 acres being leased,
I do not understand why this substation has to be directly next to a residential property.
While this may be the easiest plan, I feel that some consideration should be given to the surrounding
homeowners. I understand it probably has to be placed in a certain area, but there should be a
better option or accommodation. Urban Grid informed me that the substation and solar panels would be
monitored remotely. My next concern is will there be cameras of any sort? And if there are,
how does that affect the surrounding property owners and the privacy? I voice this concern
due to the young children and women that live in this area. I myself have a 14-year-old daughter.
I feel like there are just still so many concerns and unanswered questions that the community has.
For you to make such a quick decision on this would be unfair to all of us.
I ask you to please take your time on making this decision as it will affect so many things
in people. With all the questions and answers sound good, I challenge you to find the answers
yourself as if this were in your backyard. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.
My name is William and I have owned my home on high trade for 27 years. The first thing I would
like to discuss is how the virtual call we were told not at all the land leased was being used.
They said the panels were not going up to New Mountain, this the subdivision. Urban Grid said
they did not want to affect those homes or businesses in that area. Most of the residents on
high trade have lived there for 20, 30, 40 plus years. Why is the new subdivision
has been there three years getting a privilege over the rest of us for the homeowners?
Is it because of the increased property values? That is something I will always discern about.
If I were going to buy a home, I would want to know. If they put these panels in, I would be
sandwiched in three sides of my property by solar farms. Urban Grid stated that solar panels
would not decrease my property values, but I would like proof of that. I would like to point
out that my buffer lines will need to be adjusted. I have applied to include my property into
agricultural and forest district, which also so grant me a 200-foot buffer instead of the
purpose of 100-foot. I would really be like a 300-foot buffer. We are families who lived
off a land, including hunting for our food, the garden food plant, and the fruit trees planted
and maintained. This project will directly affect all of us. Recently, when the store shelves
were bare during the pandemic, I was able to help feed my family and friends from hunting.
We did over the winter. With this project, you will be sent in the border of my home.
Deer can't travel through the fence. I won't travel to the dead end. This project
just directly takes away my ability to hunt on my land and feed my family. I like to bring
up the work schedule. Will the work schedule for the next year be laid out for us? Everything from
equipment coming in, the noise, the dust that will create the road work from coming from one side
or the other will affect me. During the road work, I will be unable to get home with my tractor
trailer as I have only one way I can come in and out, which is from middle town. The equipment
noise, dust, and land work will affect gatherings, family events that I have on my property.
I would also like to clarify if the project is going to be done all at once or if there will be
a different phases. What happens to this project in 10 years when a scientist comes up with a new
and better way to pirate world? This company has only been a business for nine years with most
of these projects still in construction or just recently finished. How do we know that the company
will not go out of business before the contract is up and if they do, what will happen to the
solar panels? Will they be left there? Thank you for listening to my concerns and I hope you
take into consideration everything that I've said. Thank you. Thanks, sir.
Hello, my name is Caden. I am 14 years old and a lifelong resident of Pregor County,
Virginia, and high thrift. I am very active in my FSA chapter and I have been a member of the
Ailer at the FSA for three years. I have been the reporter for the past two years. I bring this
up because I have had to do research on solar panels and farms for school. I have some questions
and from what I have found there are more negatives than positives. The biggest things that I have
seen are the amount of flooding, the wildlife and habitat loss, and the loss of agriculture. My
favorite childhood memories revolve around hunting and the wildlife we see on a daily basis.
One time I watched my grandfather chase a black bear that he thought was our dog. There was also
the time when I was five years old and it was the night before Easter and my mom and I were coming home
and we saw a bunny in the yard. I ran inside and hopped in bed as fast as I could,
shooting everything because I was convinced it was the Easter bunny. Another one my favorite memories
is when I shot my first deer. I was so proud to know that I did that all by myself. When you put
the solar panels up you will scare away all of the rabbits, deer and wild animals. If and when they
do decide to come back you will have already put up your big six foot fence and you will essentially
be trapping the animals that come through. Wild animals don't like to be trapped. They will
stop going that way and if they are a predator what will they prey on? We will also be losing all
the wildlife that we love so much. You will also be losing the agricultural land. I know this
because one of the fields you will be removing is peach trees and another field you will be
losing the corn and soybeans planted there each year. Recently I competed in a national art
competition and I was in the top six. I was the youngest finalist by four years. I had to do a
video submission and in that video I said I got the idea for this project from my front porch
looking out. I only bring this up to prove that I use the agriculture this land provides in
all areas of my life. I would like to know the quality of the solar panels that will be used
in this project because the lower the quality the the urban grid uses the shorter the life
stand. Also the panels are black. Black absorbs heat and if you have 370 acres of black panels that
are hot and they will be hot and won't they increase the temperature in the area?
In solar panels there are rare earth metals and things of that kind. If one of the panels is broken
would there is rare earth metals leak into the ground? I know that most of you like the idea of
solar panels in Frederick counties but why does it have to be in a residential area?
For my understanding this is a 35 year project and most of the people involved in every aspect of
this will not live to see the end of it but I will. My generation is going to be the one
required to handle any issues in the future. My generation is going to be the ones who have
the clean up your decision. It is my generation that's going to have to restore the land into
agriculture. I don't think it will ever be like it is today. Thank you for listening to my
concerns as the next generation. Thank you ma'am. I will remind whoever is speaking with those
through to please have them state their name and match gel district when they come up to the
microphone please. I'm getting first name so I'm not getting too many last names in
match gel districts.
Thank you ma'am.
Hello my name is Glenn Redmouth. My family is own 716 Heights Road since 1964. For 56 years we have
enjoyed our property set among orchards, pastures with amazing views of the mountain. We expected that
children and grandchildren would enjoy as we have for many years. Times changed and this project
is almost certain to change it for us but most disturbing for our family is the plain
location of the substation. Not only is it at the highest point of the project but that directly
opposite across a 200 foot buffer that is already cleared with an existing transmission line.
The visibility of the facility on the hilltop will be a terrible eye sore from inside our property.
Make it even worse we recently became aware that the substation requires night lighting.
We are asking that the commission recommend a design change to negate the impact of the
substation on us. As it is the location structure lighting will change the entire character of our
property. We believe there are other options available and practical. In comments submitted last
week we asked that the substation be cited at a much lower elevation that not only lessons of
visibility but it utilizes a site where there are no required buffers. That means the structure
and its down lighting would be at least 20 feet lower with no buffer buffer separating access
to pire lines. This option A in our earlier comments also offers other advantages in an
already cleared area so no trees would need to be removed. As the applicant said they try not
to remove trees and access from the project entrance to this site is a full mile shorter than
the entrance of the hilltop site. As we stated we were really pleased to hear that the applicant
was sensitive to the views of the winery and high spewed community where they committed to
retain a large undeveloped parcel as a buffer for these properties. We are looking for the same
sensitivity that has been given to our neighbors and asks that you support reciting the substation
and retaining a small corner of mature trees. Thank you for your interest and consideration of our
concerns. Thanks sir. Appreciate it.
My name is Patricia Campbell. Back Creek District. I live close by Valery Hill
Vineyard. In 1989 my husband and I bought a house in Steven City, Frederick Townestates, did our best
to raise a family, kids, dogs, vacations when we could, normal stuff. Every fall we take the kids
to the rinkers apple orchard to pick apple and if we were lucky it would be the same day apple
butter was being made. It just made it so much extra special. We'd look forward to that every year
and my husband would say time and again I want to live out here and in 2007 he made that happen.
We built a house. He built our investment but it's not just an investment it's been our home.
He passed away or he'd be right here with me so I'm left to speak about what I want not what we
rather he'd be here or he'd be saying his own piece. I love the community. I love where I live.
I love my 5.75 acres listed wrong on the application. I love the piece and quiet. I love hearing the
broom backs cows every day. I love the big open sky. I love the immense diversified wildlife every day.
I love hearing coyote sometimes if I leave the window open in the evening. I love seeing and hearing the
geese as they fly and circle round and land in the broom backs field after they've cut corn in the fall.
Most of those things I just said that I love could change if you approve this conditional use
permit. This investment that we made didn't come with a solar panel for our next store
or we wouldn't have chose to build and live there. It didn't come with added noise major increase of
traffic major industrial construction added pollution normal maintenance or unidentified maintenance
issues. Added health risks or disturbance of the wildlife. Our investment didn't come with a
warning label that states my home's value could decrease because a utility scale solar power
generating facility is going to be built right next door. What happens if this company goes bankrupt?
What happens if a tornado goes through there? I respectfully oppose this application and hope there
can be found a more out of way place that can have a less drastic impact on people, on their property
and on their path. Thank you for your time. Thank you ma'am.
Hi, I'm Lisa Higgs and I'm in the back creek district. I resided 888 Heights Road. My family
has lived there for 25 years. I read county code section 165-103.02 and would like to review
in considering whether to approve a conditional use permit. The board shall consider the following
standards. The conditional use shall not tend to change the character and establish pattern of
development of the area of the proposed use. It makes me wonder how can the character not be changed
with a project that requires a decommissioning plan that includes removal of PV modules,
racking systems, mounting posts, electrical wiring, cabling, inverters, transformers,
connector stations, and fencing. I understand that some of the board members feel that this
is a good opportunity. They feel that this is a win for the county. It's certainly a win for
the landowner and it's a huge win for urban grid. The people that are not winning are the
residents that have to look at this every single day. According to the conditional use permit
impact analysis statement submitted by Fox Club, with appropriate screening, these property owners
will have very limited view of solar panels once installed. After the project is constructed,
the residents of the area will hear virtually nothing and see very little. The only way I see this
being accomplished is to increase the setbacks and require the vegetative buffer to be in place
before the work starts. When setting the recommendation for the height of trees, please remember
that these are six foot high chain link fence with razor wire on top. The height of the trees
should be required to hide the unappealing view of the razor wire. Another bullet from section 165
is the conditional use shall be in harmony with and shall not adversely affect the use and
enjoyment of surrounding properties. Have there been any research for alternate locations?
Are there any locations that are not right across the street from residential lots? If the board
is seriously considering approving this project, I would hope that you would keep in mind the
residents that live right in the middle of this. Increased setbacks should be required at least
300 feet. The vegetative buffer should be at the described five year view of urban grids presentation
on the first day. I don't want to see them pushing over the peach trees that are across from my house.
I don't want to see the construction that is going to take place for a year. It's offensive and
obstructive and I don't want to see any of it. So I would hope that if this conditional use
application is approved, it is approved with requirements of much better buffer than described
in the application. There are plenty of people making plenty of money on this deal. There should
be plenty of willingness to make this aesthetically pleasing for the people that have no monetary
skin in the game. We just want to be able to sit on our front porch and enjoy the views that we
have enjoyed for the last 25 years. Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.
Good evening. My name is Charlie Higgs. I'm in the back creek district. My wife and I purchased
this land around 27 years ago. We built our home and been resided there for 25 years. We chose
this property located in the agricultural district due to the beauty and serenity. And reviewing
this plan is apparent that our property is only the only property that would be surrounded
by both east and west solar panels in the front and back with the proposed 50 foot setback
as you can see in the picture. The peach trees across the street.
50 foot setback is not enough. According to county code, when considering the conditional use
permit, the board shall consider the following standard. The conditional use permit
should use should shall not have early effect in natural character environment of the county.
When we purchase our property, we pay a price for property in certain zoning locations.
We'll do it as zoning if you can change to meet the purse or our industrial needs.
I empathize with the fact that the farming is hard. I understand the farming is getting more
difficult and farmers are looking for ways to diversify. However, just because utility-grade solar
farm has the word farm in it, it does not make it agriculture. It is industrial. It seems like
a bit of a stretch to complete this project under conditional use permit. But if the board members
are going to approve this, you're responsible to ensure that this plan is appropriate for the
area and that the residents that are impacted by this are heard in their concerns taken seriously
will make your decision. Currently, we are blessed to sit on our front porch and experience many
types of wildlife grazing and passing through. We've been told that there's no impact of wildlife,
but remember, 668 acres will be fenced off. As anyone determined to loss a revenue of this project,
loss of apple, peach crops, loss of soybean, hay, grazing land, and most significant, the loss of jobs.
The workers who tend this property spend their money earned locally to support their families.
How is this benefiting them? I continue to hear this as a win-win for the county and for the farmers.
Also here that as a resident, it is a benefit to me. My question is how. I can assure you that I
will never see a significant reduction in my elector bill from this project. If this project moves
forward, our proposal is 300-foot setback with native vegetation and trees from day one,
so that we are not subject to this eyesore. We want the buffer in place that's shown in the
solar grid presentation five-year growth point equal to the height of the fence. We also
propose that the fence should be that a green weave vinyl chain lane. We also, these construction
pictures are for urban grid's brow farm project in Enrico County. The other pictures show
our current view and the view we will have with the solar farm. These are examples of why we
are demanding buffer for the start of the project. And also let me remind you that just south of our
property, there are 650 acres of lost agriculture. In the very near future, Carlos will begin to
mine this property, boarding both heights and chapel rows. Not just not sure how much more the
residents of the back creek can absorb, but I appreciate your time and listening to me this evening.
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
Ronald Wine Back Creek District. 400 football fields, that's a lot of panels.
There's a product that leaches out of the panels. It's called EVA,
ethylene vinyl acetate. I hear it's very not compatible to human consumption.
The construction is only going to run nine months on the job and that doesn't seem like a big
proposition for the county of Frederick to look forward to a lot of money.
It's not much money or time for local businesses to make much money.
A major concern to mine is stormwater runoff, which will be considerably more from what I
understand. We live on Klein's mill and right now the runoff is ducted away very inadequately.
I just think it's going to lower property values. I know they say the trees are going to grow
quick and we won't see anything, but the way the property goes around there, I think we'll be
able to see it pretty good. Thank you very much.
Hi, I'm Frank Jenkins. I live in the Back Creek District. I also live South of
Klein's Mill Road. I do have some concerns about the stormwater issues. We have a soil that runs
through runs from up yard and mine and it currently can't handle the water that it gets
to and get a heavy rainstorm. Eighteen and a half million square feet of panels is certainly a lot
and I can't imagine if the stormwater runoff's not going to increase. Secondly, I have concerns
about the chemical makeup of these solar panels. I've read enough to know that cadmium tell you
right is an element that's put into these panels, highly toxic, number six on the cancer causing
agents that I've seen and I hear that when it is involved in a fire it can also vaporize and
get into the air. We have some heavy winds out in this area. I have concerns about that. I have
concerns about the pile driving that's going to occur from seven o'clock to seven p.m. Monday through
Saturday. That's not acceptable. The construction times need to be pulled way back. Seven p.m. working in
this area is not acceptable. I work in the city and come home at night and the last thing I want
to hear is pile driving going on. I'm concerned about the maintenance issue. How soon or how often
is there going to be an inspector out here to inspect these panels to make sure that they're safe
and sound and they're not degrading and causing environmental pollutants to be put into the air
we breathe and the water that we drink. I'm downstream of this thing and have very heavy concerns
about that. I've worked all my life to buy a home that I have now on Klein's Mill Road
and in a approval of this project you're basically going to take that life's work and turn it
into something that's now looking at a light industrial use which in no way should have been
approved by CUP application. This should have required a whole rezoning of this project to make
it a light industrial use and not to CUP. This is not agriculture in any way. The whole reason
I bought my home here was because of the setting and the rule environment that it has currently.
Secondly, it's quite troubling to me that the zoning ordinance was amended in January of
this year and anticipation of this project coming in. CUP should not have been the way this went.
I thank you for my time here tonight and for listening to my concerns and I hope the
supervisors and the people on the board taking the consideration the concerns of the residents
of Frederick County. Your whole purpose is to support, protect and have our best interest at
heart. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir.
All right. There you go. I'm David Lenscomb. I've
bought an all-in precinct of Gainesburg District. I own property there on Valpheus Road.
84, 8, 53. I will have solar panels on my right side and my back side toward Klein's Mill Road.
The first thing I want to say is that I'm thinking that the project that's going to
be worth $114 million, it would have been very helpful for them to print a portfolio
of their maps and their exhibits and their plans. The only thing I have in writing is the letter
from the Planning Commission. That being said, one thing I noticed is on the landscaping that the
the corner of Klein's Mill Road, Valpheus Road is listed as forest. It is not forest. It was
logged a few years ago. It's wasteland at this point. It needs to be landscaped. Also,
coming off Klein's Mill Road on the east side of the property goes back to an inside corner.
This has been forested. It is in fact an old orchard that's full of derelict bin boxes, modular
homes, trailers, it's a mess. It needs to be cleaned up and landscaped. Landscaped the whole
thing and not to the minimum. I definitely agree that the landscaping should be performed first
and that I see no deciduous trees doing any good in the wintertime and they're going to take
many years to grow up. Chainlink fits and can also be disguised with plastic inserts like
it's done at the Alden convenience center for our garbage and trash receptors there.
This makes it not even look like Chainlink at all. The 130AKV line that's going to be tied into
it goes from the Valkyrie station to Hanshire County. It looks like that the energy that's
harvested on this so-called farm is going to Hanshire County, West Virginia and not to the
benefit of the citizens of Virginia who should be benefiting from this. Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Hi, my name is Amanda Compton and I am a resident at 11.96
Heights Road, the Back Creek District. I've been a resident there for the past 10 years.
Although I have been an agricultural major and sympathized with property owners in the
wanting to find alternative uses for their fields, I think that this project will be detrimental
to the residents in the area and their property values. Number one and also to the rural aspect
and why we all move to that area or both homes in that area. Just in the past 10 years of me
living there, my property value has actually dropped $65,000 and I have a beautiful view
where my house is. That is going to be hindered completely by the entrance, the construction
entrance to the project on Heights Road which will be directly across my property. So I'm
very concerned about that. I think that the traffic there is already a little sketchy because
of the hill and the way the road dips, often pulling out of my driveway, there are cars that
come up on me very quickly. So I think there's going to be a problem with all the construction
vehicles and the heavier load of traffic. I think that that area which is used by a lot of
bikers and runners, people out walking their dogs. Currently it's a very beautiful place to do so
and I think that's going to be ruined by this project. I think it won't be very safe for people to
do so. Also I have a business that I run out of my property. I am a question and run a horse
business and having the increased noise, the increased dust, the increased traffic, all that
is going to affect my business which again will be directly across from the entrance to this
project. I think that if there's a choice between this project and a housing development,
I would much rather see the project done but in a better way like many of the other residents in
the area have stated so well. So and the other thing the last thing I want to mention is the
environmental impact. Yes, we have coyotes in the area, we have deer, we have a large population
turkey. There are called eagles on Climb Road, Mill Road which is where that little wetland is
and I really think all that is going to be disturbed. Next door to me they've decimated the
apple orchard recently in the past month and just the impact that I felt from the wildlife coming
over to my property and I have seven and a half acres there. I've seen an increase in a lot
of small animals there. So I would like to say that I oppose the project but if it must move
forward I think there needs to be a change in the entrance and also the fencing and again the
setback and all the other issues that other people have stated. So again thank you very much.
Thank you ma'am.
My name is Nancy Trotman. My husband is standing behind me. I live right off Climb
Mill Road in the back creek district and there are two concerns that I don't think I've heard
satisfactory answers to. One is when Mr. Provost was talking about the energy that would be
produced by these solar panels it goes from direct current to alternating current. In doing
research even just for our home and probably trying to install solar panels it creates
dirty electricity which means EMS are emitted and nothing has been addressed about that. We know
the problems with EMS. They cause health problems. Cancer, sleep disturbances and other issues
of health. So I feel this has not been taken into consideration at this time for this project
and I haven't heard anything at all about it. Yes I'm sure it's clean once it's converted to AC
or energy but where is this converted? Is this converted on site? Is it taking if it is
taking place on site? What is the amount of EMS that are going to be emitted? Are they going to
be able to monitor these EMS and if so what are they going to do to remediate it if these EMS
are high? So this is a concern for us. I even found in research that trees growing next to
some solar panels even just in private residences were being affected. Their growth was being
affected. The tree trunks were growing crooked and people couldn't figure out why but once they
remediated the EMS then the tree started growing properly. So if this does this to trees what's it
going to do to humans? So this is a concern of ours. The other thing I am looking at is they
never said who will most benefit from the power generated from these solar panels. Is it
Frederick County? Is it going elsewhere? Who is going to be the most consumer of this?
And then also I am concerned about how this affects our property values and property taxes.
I can't see how this is going to help. I don't see how I think if I were going to buy a house now
we were only here for five years. If I were going to buy a house now and I saw these solar panels
in nearby I would not buy the house. So I hope that all of you will please take all of this into
consideration especially the health issues because our environment is polluted as it is and I
would hate to see anything more added to that. Please thank you for your consideration and your
time. Thank you ma'am.
Mr. Chairman that was the last speaker that we have for the public hearing this evening.
Okay here in that news and the one else coming forward I will close the public hearing.
portion. We had a lot of comments there and we appreciate everybody's patience for the
procedures that we had to do. So I will turn it back over to commissioners questions. Mr. Oates.
Yeah I think back in January the supervisor really did a disservice and a boneheaded
decision to make this a CEP process. Let's talk about what they can do about right right now.
You've got enough land there that can support 133 houses by right. So you build roads houses
the farmers gone forever and up until now that was the only recourse that farmers and orchards had
if they couldn't make a go but they had some bad years they had to sell property
and get money and I'm a science surveyor I've dealt with a lot of them and a lot of them didn't
want to do it and they'd call me as a last resort and then they got the thing that was worse of
all neighbors. So you creating these two to five acre lots and now you have people that feel
they're entitled to tell you what you can do on your farm. If they don't like noisy outdoor sex
get rid of your cattle. So you invite that scenario into it and it's it's turning to a real struggle
for farmers and orchards just to make a go of it. To me this is the perfect solution because the
land stays intact. It's not a pollutant there's no traffic there's a short duration for construction
nine months to ten months to construct it. The thing about the jobs I think you did yourself
with the service saying talking about jobs they're not long-term jobs that no you seem to throw
that into the equation but I would support this thing without any conditions because I think
it should be a bottom right because if this doesn't go through and all the crap that the
brown backs are having to go through here just to get this through it had been easier for them
to chop the farm up and then you would have pollution you'd have 1300 trips per day on the roads
you'd have the 133 drain fields and wells out there other things they can do by right if it was
to stay a farm they were talking about chemicals well what do you think gets sprayed on trees and crops
constantly herbicides and pesticides that's a whole lot more pollution of what these panels
would ever create if they could create any at all as far as dust they go in there start plowing
fields that's a lot of dust and that's by right the fences cordell lot solar burger
now surveyed a lot of property line for them they've put up eight foot fences around the
orchards to keep the deer out because of all the damage so whether it stays this or there
by gets your wish and it turns into a full-fledged orchard with added pesticides herbicides
you're going to put an eight foot fence around to keep the deer out and it's their land and they
have right to do it so I really think the supervisor screwed up by leaving minor role subdivisions major
subdivisions as a by right use and the farmers only action to take without going through all this
crap when this is the perfect solution for them they can do this the farm stays in the family
30 35 years from now if they're grandkids a great grandkids want to get back into farming the land
search ready to go also don't agree that the county should be involved in the mitigation to pull
them out the end that should be between the landowner and the panel company I don't know why
taxpayers need to get involved and be settled with the responsibility making sure it gets cleaned
up in the end so again I'll find with passing this without any conditions whatsoever
because everything that's being done here much worse could be done by right without any
public say so and by making this a CUP process and I believe the same night that this was turning
to a CUP right before that the supervisor has made a comment that they need to have less CUPs
and then they turn around adopted this so I think they've done a disservice to a lot of the
citizens and especially the farmers farmers and orchards to get a short end of the stick on this one
thank you mr. Rose for your candid comments anyone else mr. Thomas I generally don't like CUPs
I probably everybody knows that but and the reason I don't like CUPs is if you have a large
capital investment if there's a violation of the CUP there's no way the county is going to pull
that CUP if there's a hundred million dollar investment out there and they violate CUP really
Frederick County is going to go in and pull that CUP fat chance but we have to have some way to
control solar panels in the county solar panels have a good use they're a good diverse
uh power source I'd like to see us require solar panels on on on new building construction
but I don't like to see us take 600 acres out of agriculture to put solar panels on
in this case I think it's an acceptable use I certainly agree that we don't want 135 acre
lots out there uh with all the traffic and everything because there'd have to be massive
road repairs or I mean you want to talk about disruption we put 130 families out there we're
going to have a whole lot more disruption than the solar panels for six months there's going to
be disruption during the construction of these solar panels after that yeah people are going to
see them and they'll get used to them they might not like them they probably never will like them
I'm sure there's some people there that are going to have solar panels on two sides that are
never going to be happy with their view but you know I guess it's a choice at that point they can
put up buffers or whatever that I would like to see a few changes as far as driving piles
pile driving can be a pretty noisy activity and pile driving at seven o'clock at night
might not be the best idea uh you know even if you cut it back to a five thirty or six o'clock in
the evening that you would stop you could still do construction but no power driving activities
you drive piles and that's a pretty noisy activity I mean we've all heard piles being driven
and I'm not sure if I lived out there if I'd want to hear that uh the other thing that uh just
because of the the structure of the where these solar panels are and where they're going to be
driving piles I think maybe we ought to have a condition in there that for the adjacent properties
they should do a crack survey or do a building integrity survey before they start driving piles
I have seen nearby houses being damaged through the vibrations of the uh pile driving activity so
if I was one of those property owners out there I would be going around taking pictures of
the inside and the outside of my house uh I know we make car mutes do that in the blasting surveys
that they have to go around and do building integrity surveys I think maybe that's something
that uh should be offered for any house within you know five hundred feet of where there's
going to be pile driving activity that there's a building integrity survey and pictures taken so
if there is cracks in the house uh if they lose their water systems uh I don't think this would
bother any wells it you know there it's going to be shallow piles it's going to be probably five
foot deep but uh something like that I think could help uh I agree that uh we ought to pass this
uh I think it's uh I'm not sure how much it's going to benefit to county but uh there's no reason
to not pass it I guess is what I'm uh the biggest reason to not pass it is having houses out there
so I think the the benefits outweigh the cons at this case thank you mr. Thomas
anyone else concerns questions mr. Jewel Mr. Chairman agriculture needs to change along with
everything else we've got to be able to help agriculture we don't help agriculture we're going to
lose agriculture just like mr. Oet said you can have 133 houses there I I moved here 25 years ago
from a county that was agriculture that's no longer agriculture because that what they thought
was the right thing to do is put house in there this is an opportunity for the county to get
income with no services attached to this help agriculture and help folks now urban grid we've
been working with urban grid the past two weeks and you've seen the questions and there'll be
additional questions coming out and I think that this all can be fleshed out where for the most part
everybody will be satisfied and is there going to be happy now but it is I honestly think as I've
said several folks it's a win win it's a win for agriculture it's a win for the county and I
really think that it's the right thing to do thank you sir anyone else mr. Morrison very much in
support of this for a variety of reasons but the really the two things I want to bring up right
now is if the developers listen to some of these suggestions I think with very little impact to them
they can minify a lot of what's going on here and it would be much worse if we put to other uses
now yes there will be a temporary time it'd be great if we could plant 10-year-old trees
but it doesn't work that way it's going to be a period of transition it's going to be
uncomfortable and our position here is not to make everybody happy I tried that with my wife
in it just doesn't work thank you appreciate it thank you good luck with your wife yeah
anyone else I too I'll just voice a small opinion I do believe that as mr.
jewel and everyone has said our local agricultural industry is challenged challenged in many ways
with a change in environment changing world if we have out there one thing we all it can be
certain of the the world will change and I grew up here on my life and the changes I've seen
are remarkable and I do believe though in clean energy that we do have to find alternative resources
and this is a step I agree with mr. Oates I don't believe as we've went through committee with
this that this should be a conditional use permit I believe that that was the wrong step also
and I support him in his candid comments on that and but I do believe this will be a win win as
mr. jewel said for if not me Frederick County but the agriculture industry and as mr.
Thomas says they will get used to they will get that there will be minimal impact at the beginning
or be major impact that they'll be minimal at the end so I think it'll be a good project so without
any other comments this is yep mr. I agree with everything that's been said by the group up here
and it's going to be tough for me to vote the way I'm going to vote simply because I retire
from first energy so thank you thank you mr. Ripley so if there's no other comments then I'm here
and this is uh that creek to this mr. Jules house that serves like big emotions mr.
mr. Chairman I like to make the motion that we approve the conditional use permit
0 3-20 for boxclubs solar LLC thank you do I have a second second I'll go mr. Thomas on the
second and we'll start a vote I'll go back to mr. Klein Jr. Yes oh yes oh yes
Thomas yes yes Dawson yes Morrison yes and a chair votes yet so you now just vote of yes
go to the board of supervisors their next meeting I appreciate everyone I appreciate all the
citizens that came and and went through the procedure tonight if they can hear me and thank you
for your comments thank you mr. Chairman members of the commission thank you our next item on
the agenda is also a public hearing and mr. Klein will be presenting with the ordinance amendment
to the Frederick County Code chapter 165 zoning article two supplementary use to the regulations
mr. Klein Mr. sir thank you mr. Chairman members of the planning commission this one
should still be relatively fresh as you recall you will discuss the item on May the 6th and this
is a proposed amendment to chapter 165 the zoning ordinance to the and to the development review
fee schedule to reduce the fee for a conditional use permit for a commercial telecommunication
facility the purpose of this reduction in fees is to encourage commercial telecommunication
facilities to locate in those areas that are underserved in particular those areas west of
interstate 81 in December 2019 the board of supervisors adopted our two track process for the
review and approval of telecommunication facilities you will recall that this includes
byright towers up to 50 feet in height that would be approved administratively by the zoning
administrator and then our standard process projects for towers greater than 50 feet in height
which would continue to require a conditional use permit see you p fees for these types of
uses were identified during those discussions as a potential barrier to local service providers
in applying for telecommunication facility permits the board of supervisors further directed
staff following the approval of this ordinance amendment to reevaluate the fees with the
intention of reducing that fee the development review and regulations committee discuss this item
at their February 27th meeting at that time staff proposed a fee for towers greater than 50
feet in height of 750 dollars consists it with the other uses fee for conditional use permits
during the DRC discussion they recommended a tiered fee schedule based on tower height specifically
for towers greater than 50 feet in height and towers less than 100 feet in height a fee of
$1,500 and for towers greater than 100 feet in height maintaining that $7,000 current
CUP application fee following the DRC discussion the board held at their March 25th meeting they
adopted a temporary code amendment to reduce that fee which expired on May the 24th and they
reduced the fee to $750 at the time that reduction was to bring into compliance a number of
zoning violations for towers that had been directed illegally and trying to get those owners
to comply with the the code and go through the application process while also encouraging new
towers to help increase the broadband service capacity throughout the county the planning
commission again discussed the site on May 6th and this body generally concurred with the DRC
recommended fee schedule based on a tiered tiered fees based on tower height the board of supervisors
then discussed this item last week on May the 27th and directed a fee of $750 be advertised
for public hearings the board stated that the reason for setting this fee was that it should only
cover those costs associated with the advertising signage and notifications to adjacent property
owners associated with process in the application following a public hearing this evening staff is
seeking a recommendation from the planning commission to forward to the board of supervisors
on this ordinance amendment i'm happy to answer any questions you may have thank you thank you
thank you mr. Klein any questions for mr. Klein we've got one butch Thomas sir the board's
direction was to cover the fees or cover the costs directly associated with it now does
the rest of our fee structure is that what it covers because $750 we have a lot of other
fees for rezoning of housing and things that are much higher than that are are we being
capricious setting our fee schedule i guess i'm asking because if if we reduce this for
communication towers what does that do to the rest of our fee structure does it throw it out
that we have to redo our whole fee structure because we're not using the same standard for
everything else as we are for cell phone towers i think i can't speak to all of the other fees
what i can do is speak to the fee that was specifically directed by the board to be amended
which was specific to telecommunication towers and to bring that fee in line with other
conditional use permit applications under the development review fee schedule the other uses for
conditional use permit which is all conditional use uses with the exception of cottage occupations
which are small business home individual homeowners is $750 the fees for advertising and
notifications is closer to the $750 fee for conditional use permit than it is to the $7,000 fee
that currently exists for telecommunication facilities so i hope that context gives you a
little bit clear picture of why that fee in particular needs to be amended
it doesn't answer whether or the rest of our fees are arbitrary or not
i was going to say when you said capricious stuff i don't think the fees that but all the fees are
definitely arbitrary thank you any other questions all right this is a public hearing i will open
a public hearing even like to come forward to speak before this matter please come forward
this time mr chairman i believe we have nobody left in the building in the back of the building
lucky them this time that i'll close the public hearing any other questions or discussions
mr. Joel mr. chairman mr. Thomas brought up the structure last time we discussed this and
um we've been involved with this from back in October the one argument we've been hearing
time and time again is there are families individuals that cannot get internet they want a tower
not the wireless companies but families they want a tower so i don't know if this is even possible
doing it but is it possible to structure it where you'd have personal use at $750
you're smaller internet providers at $1,500 and then the large at 7,000 you know the
we saw a tower pass tonight but i also attended the the past uh in the in the earlier in the year
where it was a real problem with the the tower over there in shrandon park and that was multiple
meetings that was not one time so there was cost there and i do think that there has to be
something in place for the the whole argument was the individual i think the $750 that's three
months direct TV call it like it is so you know if someone's trying to do that for their
families so they can get internet good for them but i don't think that i think we have to do we have
to break it away and it has to be very specific we can't have a company coming in saying i'm a
hand radio and then putting up a cellular tower it really we really need to be very specific with
the wording and not allowing that to happen so that's my opinion on this thank you mr.
jewel and i will probably go back to mr. Klein because i think that was the procedures that we were
trying to we started with we've been working on it is that very structure if i'm not
mistaken mr. Klein if you like to respond to mr. jewel think that was the discussion that was
had at this body on the six that was very similar to the discussion that the development review
and regulations committee had speaking to the type of provider that was looking to apply for
conditional use permit i think they the drc at least had settled on height being that determining
factor there was some talk at that at the drc mean about dividing the height 100 feet and less
seem to be towers for local service providers individual property owners where towers over 100
feet in height were more of your large telecommunication companies like that or tower you all so
earlier this evening there is discussion on the may six meeting about even increasing that fee
structure to 75 feet and then 75 feet to 125 feet and then greater than 125 feet all of those
comments were recorded and conveyed to the board the board did consider various heights but at the
end of the day the consensus among the board was trying to bring that fee down to increase the
ability of providers to locate in those underserved areas of the community were broadband services
limited or nonexistent and the most efficient way to do that was recommending that $750 fee which
it was consistent with all of our other CUP applications so that was the recommendation that was
brought back for public hearing and that's you know certainly you all can make an alternative
recommendation you all can convey comments back to the board um but that is what is before you
this evening right mr. Oaks it's just a shame we're going I think we're going to be seeing a lot of
these towers coming it'd be nice to someone with what people know that there is internet available
through a satellite and be a lot cheaper as far as building a tower that's 100 to 150 foot tall
agree any other comments questions thank you mr. June oh I'm sorry mr. Morrison I'm not used
to the panoramic setting here yet you get an air horn yeah most of what everybody said here is
uh very proper for what we're trying to do now uh I've been on satellite now for eight years
does everything I need to do I had to up it up for church since I had to use more bandwidth
for church services but uh bigger part of the problem has been a great deal of misinformation
has been distributed throughout the county as to how this is working and we have to be careful
that we don't feed the misinformation any further to me the primary objective here our school
superintendent has seen to base this entire curriculum on every student having internet even
though he knows not every student has internet but he goes ahead with it anyway we need either to
facilitate the process where individual families can get access to this as reasonably as possible
or the big push will be coming for the county to pay for it all so we need we need a moderate path
that we have to deal with now I noticed some head shaking when we talk about single use
versus multiple use and things like that because those are virtually impossible to monitor
but again my focus is on getting the individual family access if they deemed they needed at a
reasonable rate thank you sir anyone else that I need a motion to move forward
if I want to make a motion I make a motion that we go with the idea of a tiered
what we've discussed 750 or what I can't make I gotta make a motion here we can make a motion
if I get some clarity here to maybe we can make a motion but we got a deal with what's in front of this
yeah it's either vote to deny it's either motion didn't deny what's in front of us
or to approve so no sir
we said it forward does it recommend it okay so I got it
no I think we just need to make a motion you made a motion to send it forward
all right do I have a second for that motion to send us forward as is presented before us
second I got a second
just a point of clarification is getting late in my mind is slipping what is the tiered structure
that we are recommending to be moved forward we're not we're not recommended a tiered structure
they went away they rejected that they sent it back to us just to be a $750 fee for these towers
thank you thank you we're just voting on the $750 fee is all this before us I have a motion to
approve from mr. and brogie we got a second for mr. manual and this time I'll do a vote
so this would be a yes to approve or no to not send it forward I'll start with mr. molded
molded yes more than yes
awesome no sure but yes Thomas no it's no manual yes
March and yes June now and brogie yes I have the chair votes no
six I believe we have a tie
I did that right
so yeah the motion fails at that point I believe because it's time goes
okay so it'll go back to the board with six to six vote
I would rather that the planning commission had an affirmative motion okay
so I need to have another motion then all right yes sir I'll entertain another motion I'll
make a motion that we deny the $750 because I think the fees inappropriate for the amount of work
that's involved I have a second to deny it I got a second from mr. Thomas on this vote
and it is getting late now this vote is to motion to deny the $750 fee send it back
so a vote of yes would be denied no be your you like what we have it for us so I will start with
who does start with before you now I'll start with mr. Klein
and right motion to deny the yes yes vote will be a motion to deny and not go with the $750
so I guess what we'll be to deny okay
you yes
Martin yes
Daniel Nav
Oh yes
Thomas yes
yes
fasten no
Morrison no
thank you
well let's go turn out
Kenny yes I'm the chair yes six so it's yes to a vote I got yes I got eight to four is that correct
that's correct mr. Chairman it's going to move forward to the board of supervisors with a
recommendation of denial to deny and the board will be able to deal with it dispose of it as they
please correct thank you
appreciate that the our last public hearing I am is the orders to amendment to the Frederick
County Code chapter 165 zoning article one general provisions mr. Klein yes final item of the
evening thank you for your patience this is get a public hearing item on zoning enforcement
violation penalties and you all have again discuss this item on the on the sixth presently
the county enforces the zoning ordinance through a misseminor process but the state laws
permits the use of civil penalties by localities if the county adopted a civil penalty for
specified violations state law would require that the county pursues civil penalties for those
violations up to it accumulated fine limit of five thousand dollars before pursuing the misseminor
process for those same violations if the objective for the revisions to the zoning ordinance
is to maximize fines in such a way to create a disincentive for violation specifically repeated
repeated violations proceeding sooner to the one thousand fifteen hundred and then repeated
two thousand dollar fines for subsequent today periods remains the most effective approach I think
I skipped a slide actually the development review and regulations committee discussed this item
at their February 27th meeting and the planning commission discussed this item on May 6th and
agreed with increasing the fees under the current misseminor process to the maximum penalty permitted
by state code which is again that one thousand fifteen hundred and two thousand dollar
fine maximums the board of supervisors discussed this item on May 27th and we're an agreement with
increasing the fees to maximize the permitted fees in order to discourage repeat violations
specifically following the public hearing this evening staff is seeking a recommendation from
the planning commission to the board of supervisors on this proposed ordinance amendment
happy to answer any questions you have regarding this item thank you thank you mr. Klein any
questions thank you sir I'll open the public hearing anyone would like to come forward to speak
to this matter please come forward soon we have no one there is nobody left thank you thank you
I'll close the public hearing any other questions discussions to this matter I think it was fully
better that committee and it's been well received so do I have any questions
does the hearing none I'll entertain a motion I move that we recommend increasing the fines
for violations to the maximum we can have a second I'll second that mr. molden yes
morson yes boss and yes but yes amish yes but yes and your yes first and yes
dual yes and both yes chair votes yes both unanimous it goes forward with a yet's
approved vote to the next board supervisor meeting and with that that's it with our public hearing
our next item on their agenda there was no we have no action items no impression discussion no other
and we have a meeting set for our next meeting mr. chairman we will not meet on the 17th of June
so we'll keep the meetings down to hopefully one a month okay we'll plan on meeting in July
and we'll determine the best day if you will to actually meet based upon the the work that's
coming on in sounds good thank you that time I'll entertain a motion to adjourn just chairman a second
up one moment while we're talking about future meetings I would like to recognize to the planning
commission that are the board of supervisors are their last meeting had a discussion on a particular
item which actually led us back to the point of requesting the planning commission and board
of supervisors do what we had said we were looking to do and that is get together in some sort of
work session or retreat so we'll take that that request from the board of supervisors highlight
some items topics and hopefully set that up and all likelihood we'll probably do it around the
August timeframe hopefully the meeting situation opens up to enable us to do that we do have one
comp plan amendment that was submitted therefore as we usually do we meet in the summertime
with the board to discuss that so I would anticipate as getting together the planning commission
in the board of supervisors and we'll have more information about that as it gets pulled together
thank you and that will take the place of the August meeting that'll be maybe in addition to
the August meeting in addition to or in can we'll determine the best time for that with the board
I think I had a motion to adjourn I think I had in left seconds to count and then all those in
favor we're adjourned
