We had outside counsel here, proposed outside counsel

and I gave some background as well.
I know I've also provided some follow-up memos,
the Board had a couple of concerns
as far as particulars of the retention arrangement
and exactly how this would work.
I think I've responded all to all of that.
The memos didn't hear any questions back.

Dr Chaimann, wne 달 diaw
hни?
I would move that we adopt the proposed resolution as Mr Williams has presented for the
opioid litigation authorization.
I heard the motion is our second, and the second, any discussion?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman, members of the board, using drugs and the things that go along with it
as a personal decision.
It is an unfortunate decision, and I had a sister pass away from that decision, so it is
personal for me.
However, I do not believe that suing the drug companies and the distributors of these
pharmaceutical medications is the correct way to go.
I'll give you a new reason and an example.
Fentanyl is one of the drugs that is very often used or thrown out there as a frequent
drug used and overdosed on in our locality.
Fentanyl also happens to be the exact same drug that if you are having a heart attack
today, our paramedics who come to help you will be giving you to help save your life.
That same drug will also be the same drug that that paramedic, or such as myself, and
I would work on you in the past, would use if you broke a leg and had severe pain.
It was my discretion on many, many incidents to decide whether the patient needed an
narcotic or whether they did not.
I don't believe that it is the drug company's liability to know if the doctor is writing
prescription simply to allow somebody to be a drug user or not to be a drug user.
But I find it really difficult to think that we are going to sue a company that uses
a drug, or not uses, makes a drug that is going to help me for a heart attack or help
my son or daughter if they fall and break the leg or have other things.
Simply to generate some revenue, and I feel that that is what this litigation is.
If there is anybody responsible for a lot of the drug overdoses in our region, it is
the end user who has either tried to gain the system to get drugs that they should not
have obtained legally in the first place, or through smuggling from out of the country
or manufacture illegally.
I find it very difficult that we are going to pursue a case against manufacturers who
also obviously are making the drug for our benefit, so therefore I cannot support this
motion moving forward.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Further discussion, anyone?
Anyone at all?
All right.
Supervisor Fisher.
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Dun's not here.
Supervisor Graywood.
No.
No.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
That brings us to Code Norton's Committee.
They are not able to be with us this evening, so I have asked Mr. Williams, County Attorney,
to take that report as well as the, I think there were some slight technical credits.
There are.
Thank you, sir.
The details of this, actually, we have the fire chief and the assistant fire chief
here who can go into any information on the details of this.
This did work its way through the process, and I know that the chief and the fire and
the assistant fire chief spent a lot of time also discussing this with the volunteer
community, and again, I'll defer to them on that.
The two technical changes are that we would change if the board approves this going forward
to public hearing are on the second page.
There is a definition of executive committee, and it says a body established pursuant
to section 89-4.15 of this chapter.
There is no 4.15 that should be 89-5, and we will make that change.
It was one of the perils of the editing process.
The other change is, on the last page of it, section 89-16, it's titled Authority of
the County Administrator, amount of fees.
That was the way it was originally, but it's part of this process.
We changed that so it was the board of supervisors that would be setting the fees.
The language within the actual text of the ordinance has been changed to say board
of supervisors, but the title, and I think that one was my oversight, didn't get changed,
so it should be authority of the board of supervisors in the title of that.
We would make those two changes if the board forwards this, and again, I know that Chief
Winneberg and assistant chief Mishack are here for further information on this.
Right, sir, thank you.
So, would the board have questions of Chief or Deputy Chief?
Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir.
It's not a question, simply to comment.
I would like to thank them both for the time and effort that's been put into this.
I know it has been a lengthy process.
I appreciate the work that has been done as far as going back into the process,
as we were nearly finished at one point.
And I know that there's been a lot of sweat and tears here in this,
and speaking with some of my volunteer chiefs in my district,
so I want to say thank you for your job well done.
All right, any other comments?
All right, how would the board like to handle this one?
Is it ready to go to public hearing as amended?
Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir.
I would so move that we forward this for public hearing.
Forward to public hearing?
Sir, second.
I get Mr. Chairman.
Is there any discussion?
All right, all those in favor, aye?
Aye.
Opposed, no.
We'll forward to public hearing.
That will bring us to the Finance Committee report.
Supervisor Slotter.
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.
The Finance Committee met on February 19th at 8 a.m.
Items 1 through 6 were approved under consent agenda, and I would so move.
I heard the motion is our second.
Second, Mr. Chairman.
Second, is there any discussion?
Is there a roll call?
Supervisor Graber?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells?
Aye.
Supervisor Slotter?
Aye.
Supervisor Fisher?
Aye.
Chair about the eye and the motion carries.
Supervisor Slotter.
Item number 7, the Public Works Director request a landfill supplemental
appropriation in the amount of 600,000.
This amount represents unexpected expenses related to multiple projects.
The Public Works Committee has approved the request, and I would make a motion to
approve the Committee recommended approval.
Motion to approve is our second.
Second, Mr. Chairman.
And the second, is there any discussion?
Hearing none.
Supervisor Graber?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells?
Aye.
Supervisor Slotter?
Aye.
Supervisor Fisher?
Aye.
Chair about the eye and the motion carries.
Item number 8, the Registrar request a general fund supplemental appropriation
in the amount of $47,542.
This amount represents funds required to hold the March 2020 Democratic Presidential
Primary.
Local funds are required.
The Committee recommends approval, and I would so move.
The motion is our second.
Second, Mr. Chairman.
And the second, is there any discussion?
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Supervisor Graber?
It pains me greatly that we have to spend this out of local funds,
but it is a state requirement, so therefore I feel that we have to pass it.
But I just wanted to make mention of that.
We had no choice.
Further discussion, anyone?
Supervisor Fisher?
Aye.
Supervisor Slotter?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells?
Aye.
Supervisor Graber?
Aye.
The Chair about the eye and the motion carries.
Item number 9, the Old Dominion ASAP Director request a court services fund transfer
in the amount of $9,000 from personnel to operating.
The transfer of policy required board of supervisor approval to transfer out a personnel.
There was an attached memo in the board packet related to increases in water and sewer and
so forth in the city.
The committee recommended approval and I would so move.
Bird, the motion is our second.
Second, Mr. Chair.
Any discussion?
Anyone?
Supervisor Fisher?
Aye.
Supervisor Slotter?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells?
Aye.
Supervisor Graber?
Aye.
Chair about the eye and the motion carries.
The Winchester Regional Airport Director request an airport fund supplemental
appropriation in the amount of $10,000.
This amount represents funds needed for the Wings and Wheels event.
No local funds required.
The committee recommends approval and I would so move.
Bird, the motion is our second.

Aye.
Supervisor Slotter?

Number 11, the Winchester Regional Airport Director request an airport fund
supplemental appropriation in the amount of $40,000.
This amount represents funds for anticipated fuel purchases.
No local funds required.
The committee recommends approval and I would so move.
Bird, the motion is our second.
Second, Mr. Chair.
And the second.
Is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor Graber?
Mr. Fisher, Supervisor Fisher invited me out to the airport and we had a walk through here
in the last week and I was really impressed with the work that is being done out there.
I think the continued support of the airport and this anticipated fuel, I don't think we'll go to waste.
I'm greatly impressed with what I'm seeing happen.
So I'm very glad to see us support them in the ways at which we have.
Thank you, sir.
Further discussion.
Mr. Chairman, I would just add that the increase in the fuel
appropriation is reflective of the increase of operation that is going on in the airport
and hats off to our executive director out there in the board that does a great job.
So thank you.
That's been outstanding, yes.
Further discussion, anyone?
Are we ready?
Supervisor Fisher?
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells?
Aye.
Supervisor Graber?
Aye.
Chair votes aye and the motion carries.
That would conclude my report, sir.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Brings us to Planning Commission Business Public Hearing, CIP.
Mr. Rattie, thank you, sir.
Thank you very well, thanks.
Members of the Board of Supervisors, this is the public hearing for the 2020- 2025
Capital Improvement Plan.
As we know, the CIP is the document which contains the schedule of those major capital expenditures
that the county may be anticipating over the next five years.
It also includes an additional category for those projects that are much farther out long-term projects.
As we also know, the CIP is no-way in indication that Frederick County will be undertaking the projects.
It's advisory.
It's a planning document, a planning document intended for use as a capital facilities,
planning document, and again, not for requesting funding allocations.
Of course, that's part of the budget process that you're deep into presently.
Once adopted, the project priorities and cost estimates may change throughout the year based
on changing circumstances.
This year's CIP contains 86 projects from a combination of schools,
parks and recreation, regional library, county administration,
fine rescue, transportation, and the Winchester Regional Airport.
The CIP continues the connection between the comprehensive plan and those capital improvements,
and probably equally important is the connection with future rezoning applications and the
capital impact model. It contains, within the document, detailed descriptions of all of the
projects. It also contains a table that identifies the specific requests from the departments,
from the entities responsible for ranking them, if you will, and providing that, such as the
School Board Airport Authority Boxing Recreation Commission.
Supporting the document are four maps, which, again, identify the general location of those
facilities. The CPPC endorsed the CIP, as did the planning commission who recommended approval,
and its conformance with the comprehensive plan back at their meeting in January of this year.
At your last, excuse me, at the January Board meeting, the Board forwarded it for public
hearing, and after that occurs here this evening, we're seeking a direction, excuse me, a
recommendation and endorsement from the Board of Supervisors on the CIP. Mr Chairman,
I'd be happy to try and answer any questions that the Board may have at this time.
Thank you, sir. Questions of Mr. Ruddy? Anyone?
Apparently not, sir. Thank you.
This is a public hearing when anyone would like to comment about the proposed CIP.
Anyone at all? Anyone? Seeing no one will close the public hearing portion.
I would board like to handle this. Mr. Chairman, I would make a motion to approve the 2020- 2025
capital improvement plan as presented. I heard the motion as our second.
Mr. Chairman. In the second, is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. I suppose I agree with you.
So as I look through the capital improvement plan, we have a little over $1.5 billion
listed there in expenditures. I'd further look at the plan and I see a lot of priorities listed
that are questionable priorities at best, and while I understand it is simply a roadmap
that may be funded and by no means is required to be funded, what I unfortunately have seen is
some of these programs that are listed on that capital improvement plan. We'll have money
spent towards design phases or beginning phases of the project that does cost us millions of
dollars. If we look at the fourth high school as an example, we're nearly at $9 million
for a school that was turned down to be built just a few years ago.
Therefore, I cannot support the capital improvements plan as it is presently being presented.
Thank you. Thank you, sir. Further discussion, anyone?
Hearing none. Supervisor Fisher. Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter. Aye.
Supervisor Wells. Aye. Supervisor Graver.
No. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chair, about time. Motion carries. The CIP is adopted.
That brings us to board liaison reports. Are they ready?
Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. Supervisor Grave.
Northern Regional Commission met last Thursday. I think I have the name right there.
It was a long one.
Kendall Valley Regional.
Senator Valer. Yes, sir. You're correct. We got it.
Correct. A lot of little things they were just discussing about the ride sharing programs and
things that have been going very well financially and that they are doing well, very well financially
as far as through grants, and that is something to be commended of them. They are looking at a
study for recycling that will be coming out next month. I believe there are also some agencies
here in the county that could be interested in helping us with some of our recycling needs in the
not too distant future. So I think that there is some strong possibilities that we could have
some support in our recycling program both financially and to benefit of our citizens in the
very near future. Thank you, sir. Any other board liaison reports? Anyone?
All right. Hearing none. Citizen comments. This is a period of the meeting reserved for
citizens to comment. Share it with the board on any subject, ma'am.
If we could have your name, Magisterial District, and try to limit your comments to three minutes
or less, please. My name is Linchman. I live in Shawnee land. I'm resident of Shawnee land. I'm
here tonight to express to the members of the board the great disappointment. Many residents,
including myself, have with the recent actions of the Public Works Committee. Not only did the
Public Works Committee undermine our Board of Supervisors representative, but also showed a major
lack of respect and common courtesy to the residents of Shawnee land. Decisions of Shawnee lands
budget along with how it is spent should reflect all the citizens of Shawnee land, especially since
the residents are the sole entities who maintain Shawnee land's budget. To my understanding,
Shawnee land is governed by the Board of Supervisors. That being so wise public works even in the
middle. With the recent actions and decisions concerning Shawnee land by the Public Works Committee,
I believe it is fair to say any close working relationship with Public Works no longer exist.
Any trust that may have existed has been drastically damaged if not replenished.
Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else? Yes, sir.
That might book might up there, sir. It needs to be about three inches. Perfect. Thank you.
Yes, sir. I'm also from Shawnee land. I'm on the advisory committee.
Yes, sir. My name is Jeff Stevens. That Greek. That Greek.
All right, and I want to make it known that we wasn't completely represented on all of us
and decisions made. We wanted for the budget, we would refer that somebody be cut to make the
balance, make the budget balance a little better. We have two-thirds of the budget going to
salary and that's only one-third to go to other things and we need to trim that down a little bit
and move it closer to balance and budget without raising our fees as much.
That's all. Thank you, sir. Thank you.
Anyone else? Comment on any subject? Welcome.
Pull it back down please. There you go. Good job. Thank you.
Good evening. My name is Laura Jarell and I'm a resident of the Opec indistrict.
I was an English major so math is not my first love but I think I can do some basic math
calculations so I wanted to talk about tax rates. Frederick County's current tax rate is 61 cents,
lower than Shenandoah by three cents, lower than Warren by four, lower than Clark by 10 cents,
and lower than Winchester City by 32 and don't worry I'm not talking about Loudon.
Our county is growing rapidly. We need to invest in infrastructure to support our growing
county. A five cent tax increase sounds like a lot but if you do the math it's not really much
at all. On a house valued at 250,000 taxes at 61 cents would be $1,525. Taxes at 66 cents would
be $1,650. That's a difference of $125 a year, $10.42 a month. For a house valued at 150,000
taxes at 61 would be $915 and at 66 cents would be $990. That's $6 a month, not at all at
unreasonable request. We cannot stick our heads in the sand and pretend that there aren't
major issues that need addressing in our county. It's not just our schools that need funding
and support, law enforcement, fire and rescue are in dire need as well and while our kids are
sitting in overcrowded classrooms and schools, the Board of Supervisors spent $2.1 million
for the purchase of a rundown shopping center for office space you might one day need while
our kids need space now. It takes money to address these issues they will not fix themselves.
A five cent tax increase doesn't even begin to cover the needs in our county but at least it's
a start. If we don't address these needs now we will continue to fall further and further behind
and we will reach a crisis level situation that we will not be able to dig out of.
If you decide the risk is worth it for you fine but our kids who don't get to vote and don't get
to make most of the choices in their lives are depending on us to make good choices on their
behalf. We talk a lot about good choices and poor choices at home with our kids. My three kids
are back there. We are always trying to help them understand how the choices they make impact
themselves and others and that many choices have consequences be them good or bad. We need to show
them by example that we are willing to stand up and make a good choice. We owe it to them to provide
a safe community for them to grow up in. I urge you to advertise the five cent tax increase
for public hearing and give your constituents the opportunity to speak. Those of us on a fixed
income like myself can part with an extra six to ten dollars a month for the good of the many.
Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else like to comment?
Welcome. My name is Kristen Coons. I am a resident of Redbud and I've been a tax payer in the
county for sixteen years. I've been in Redbud for ten years. I'm a parent of a fourth grader
and a first grader at Greenwood. I'm very involved in the community. I'm a Girl Scout leader,
PTO secretary, a coach for destination imagination, managing to fit in time to come here. I'm also
a loud and county teacher which makes me a little nervous to say because I know that as soon as
someone mentions their teacher sometimes people immediately don't want to listen to what they
have to say. I'm not being self-serving. I'm not sure why teachers and educational staff in
this county are immediately thought of in a way in which some think they're being self-serving.
I'm involved in the community. I'm saddened to see how the public schools are treated
by the members of this board who don't think that we need a tax increase and certain members
of the public as well. It seems like that there's no trust in the decisions that the school staff
and school board are making and a silly little question but if you were sick, curious if you'd
go to the doctor for treatment or if you would rely on an actor who played one on TV.
I'm asking this because I wish we would not be so quick to not listen to the recommendations
that are coming from the school board and school staff. A common complaint is that the public
school system is asking for more funding. Of course they are. We continue to see more and more
development in this county and the public schools don't control that. You do. Some people think
that Northern Virginia transplants are ruining the Frederick County way of life. That's because
there's all this development that's bringing in all of the businesses that are not being
staffed with retirees. They're being staffed with people with families. In my neighborhood
alone we've had four families move in recently who are working for Amazon, Procter and Gamble
West Virginia but still they're coming in for things that are being developed in our county.
The public schools are the unlucky victims of the development in the county and the victims of
a board who have members who have a personal issue with the school system. More than that though
the children are the true victims of this poor decision making. My children deal with overcrowding
on a daily basis. I don't even want to think about what their class sizes are going to be like
when they make it to middle school and high school. Some of you don't even want to entertain
the idea of a fourth high school. My children should not be punished for this poor planning.
We absolutely should have a tax increase. There should absolutely be a fourth high school under
construction. There should be absolutely no change to the split of funding for the school system.
In fact I think it should be an increase in their percentage. There should absolutely be a way
to involve community members in your decision making processes beyond just this where it's a
little hard for us to get here and there should be the trust within the school board as well.
That was what we elected them to do and the children of this county deserve better and to
remind you I have the lovely core values just to remind you of what the board of supervisors should
be focusing on and letting others work on what they should be working on. Thank you.
Anyone else? Yes, ma'am.
My name is Jody Yeggy and I am a resident of the Red Bug District but a citizen of Frederick
County for which all of you represent. I would guess that I would technically fall into the
category of a newbie that supervisor Dunn mentioned tonight who should be paying for all these
things because we did just recently move here from out of state and as we were looking at areas
around for we got transferred out here with my husband's job and as we were looking at areas to
move we did end up deciding on Frederick County and we didn't move here because of the low taxes.
We moved here because of the school district and what I perceived when I did my research as a
school district that was supported by the community I saw new schools going up and that was something
that enticed our family to move out here and we're both working individuals we both pay taxes
we pay taxes where we came from we built a home and we're paying taxes here and I will continue
to pay taxes to support the the needs of the community as we're growing and unfortunately I've
learned that there are a few folks on the board of supervisors who maybe don't fully support
the funding of our public schools the way that they probably need to be funded and Dr.
Savine in the Board of Education presented a budget this evening and I thought it was very well
laid out they indicated their needs not their wants and I urged this entire board to take their
thought process into account to look at putting a five cent increase on the docket and keeping
historic allocations for the district in place the public schools are the place where our
media students are given a chance to be educated it is a community's responsibility to fund
and support those children thank you thank you anyone else yes sir
good evening good thank you well my wife was one that just spoke a few minutes ago Lord
Gerald my name is Chris Gerald I'm from the OPEC in district and I'm here to speak on behalf
of our children as you can see I'm a teacher of an exceptional tiny humans and this is my first
year working in Frederick County public schools I'm a resident of this district of this county
and I actually work at the school that is two miles away from my house now this is my second
career I'm 46 years old for the first 25 years of my life my adult life I was a full-time pastor
do you know how much I got paid as a full-time pastor I will tell you it was $60,000 a year
not that it's any of your business but I'm very open and that's open to the books I decided
to go in a different profession and want to invest in my children's future my three children
sitting back there they they go to the school that I work at that's Hoover Elementary School
I'm right now I'm an instructional aid you know how much an instructional aid gets started at
in on Frederick County public schools 20,000 a year 20,000 that's a fixed income right there
that I'm willing to give 5% of my income you know what that sacrifices me
two Starbucks a month two Starbucks a month that's it that is my investment I love Frederick
County public schools and board I want to encourage you tonight and as you look forward to the
future I know some of you on this board do not support our public schools but they are our
future our children our tiny humans are our future you may not care about them you may not
care about my three kids are sitting back there then I'm invested in you may not care about
the 600 students at Bass Hoover Elementary School that I walk around and I see and I pour my life
and energy into because I want to make a difference in their lives as not only with my faith
background but as a human being I want to invest in them but when you don't want to invest in
that is troublesome that's saying you don't care really about our children you don't care
about our future I know I'm starting to sound like my going back to being a pastor but I am very
passionate about this we have professionals who've gone to four years of college and many of
them have gotten their masters beyond those four years many are working off their debt still
and we have amazing professionals that are working in our public schools they are professionals
they earn what they get and we have some of the best teachers in this county who sacrifice their
time away from their family because when you're in that school you're family even my family who
are right there with me they come second nature to the kids that we're investing into and I
want us to you to think about that as you decide the budget for this county but a budget for
Frederick County school board thank you thank you sir anyone else yes sir
my name is Brian Schmidt with a backreet district I was at a special meeting for the
Shawnee land budget that was a Monday evening and from the attitude of the citizens during that
meeting I know they had another budget meeting tonight and then they spoke at public works
to move the budget forward to come to you in March and I just wanted to express some
disgust with public works because they can show that they can trim the budget but they went ahead
in behind our backs basically because they told us that we were going to have some additional
time as residents of Shawnee land to take and try to trim some of the fat and that could actually
be seen with a couple of the proposals that they got so I just want to this people have fixed
income that I know I've been a resident there for 17 plus years but I knew residents there for
40 plus years and they have to decide if you're going to take I know there's going to be no fee
increase this year but there'll have to be a fee increase next year and that's what they're not
telling us and for people who have lived there for 40 years and they have to take and decide whether
or not are they going to get chemo or are they going to pay these extra fees because public works
thinks it's a choice to them in Shawnee land I think that's just wrong so that's all I have to say
thank you sir anyone else yes sir
just pulling down there sir there you go Tim Regan Tim Regan from the back street back
creek district I've heard some things mentioned today which I find very interesting and that's
where people have mentioned that there's people of this boy that don't care about the children
I don't think there's anybody on this boy that doesn't care about our future and the children's
future I think what we want to look at is strictly and one thing only that the money is spent
correctly we know where it goes how it's being spent and why it's being spent so when you come in
from a teacher from a different district from outside you make a lot more money I understand
it's going to be tax increases nothing wrong with the tax increase providing the money is being
spent correctly and you know where it's going is there anybody I know you can't answer a question
I understand that but is there anybody on this district that on this board that knows
where every penny of the school district money goes can you you know tell me how many
gallons of milk they buy per year these are the things that have to be looked at I understand
children are our future schools have to be built it just has to be built correctly it needs
your understanding and your ability to turn around and say wait a minute that's all
thank you thank you sir anyone else anyone anyone all that would like to share with the board
all right we thank you for your comments yes ma'am
if you would like three minutes we'll be giving it to you step up please
we can't answer questions for you we're here to receive your thoughts and your comments
we meet on the second and the fourth Wednesday of every month
it'll go to public hearing yes or did we adopt it hang on it yeah okay no it will not
be coming forward again no not a question and answer but I'll be happy to talk with you after
the meeting do you want to comment to the board
so if we could have your name and and
no longer be sure of fiction City of Winchester thank you
as growing up in Frederick County I mean it's the world is so vastly different now
and the opioid epidemic is very distressing and discouraging and I think it's horrible
and it's affected this area so badly apparently that we're going to bring in you know outside
big attorneys attorneys for the big battle or recoup from big formal I don't I think that's
probably a good idea but I'd like to know more about it and I know I'm not gonna ask any
questions but I just really personally think it's insidious and there's much more to it than
meets the eye so if that's all I have to say right now but this will be an ongoing if I compile
other comments that'll be okay to present it to the board and then who then you said that I
can meet with you later on I'd be happy to talk with you about the subject and we have two
different public comment periods during each meeting the first one is restricted to agenda items
that are not subject to public hearing and then the second one is at the end of the meeting which
is where we are now and I always say I appreciate the comments about the children because that's
who's we're going to be affected it has probably been affected the most and we don't I don't
wouldn't know it I don't didn't have the lecture raising any children but I think that's the
worst home most horrible things I think that should be toppled on your all's list of what to
address and I'd like to know a lot more about it thank you thank you anyone else any comments
they'd like to share with the board seeing no one will close the public comment portion or
supervisors comments are there any mr chairman supervisor Gary I have several okay
we had our joint meeting this evening with the school board I found it very concerning that the
superintendent of schools chose not to answer several questions in which I posed to him I did have
an opportunity to quickly glance at the budget that was posted by the school board in the interim
there from the two meetings I'm concerned that I can't really get into the depth or the
meat and potatoes of the budget as it is not in categorical funding format I think it is imperative
that we truly see where the funds are going in our school district so as to assure that we are
being accountable to the citizens and which we represent with the monies in which they give us
therefore I think in going categorical funding format doesn't mean you cut the budget in any means
it simply means that you allocate the funds where this board thinks that they should be best spent
therefore I think it would be a travesty if we did not get a
budget from the school board that was in categorical funding format one other thing and this is
not meant to be a jab at anyone but I do find it very interesting as I watch folks speak here this
evening I find it interesting that many of the folks who stand to benefit the most from a tax
increase want one I've gotten a lot of phone calls from folks who would not benefit from a tax
increase being our folks who are retired or young families who are starting out and others
whom a tax increase would harm them greatly for many of them they've seen a 30% or rough
proximate 30% increase in their taxes over the last five years which is 6% a year this year's
5% tax increase would increase their taxes in additional 10% many of them have not had a 6%
increase in their revenue from their jobs per year on average over the last five years
therefore as I previously stated I cannot in any way support a tax increase and I thank you for
the time to speak. Thank you sir. Anyone else for the supervisor's comments any?
Mr Chairman.
Supervisor Fish. Back in January our first meeting we had some rules of procedures and
code of conduct and stuff that we looked at and I was under the impression we were going to
get back and look at some of that stuff again what I'd like to do if it's a consent with Mr
Chairman or the rest of the board I'd like to go back and look at that code of conduct
revise it a little bit I think it was wording in places and I had some things didn't need to be
there but I thought there were some points that deal with the type of government we have in
Frederick County that would be helpful to put in our current code of conduct so I'm willing
to head it up if you would like I'll probably need some administrative assistance time with
comes to wording and and maybe have Mr Williams look at it so I don't put my foot in my mouth
but that's something I'd like to do if if it's okay with the board.
That sounds like a consensus discussion would anyone else like to comment concerning
supervisor fishers willingness to step up and work on that.
When we talked about it originally it was we were talking about sending it back to take
another look so I would say that's good timing Mr. Fisher and if you're willing to share that
committee and do that that would be great thank you.
What else?
Chairman as you know when it was presented the first time I voted in favor of us adopting that
code of conduct so I certainly would be in favor of that.
Mr chairman yes sir if I may if there's going to be a committee formed I would desire to be a
part of that committee. Welcome any other comments? I think you volunteer it for a job yeah I think
so somebody else did too well thank you thank you very much one and all okay and I think that if
you decide you need help you ask we'll sure you'll find folks that are willing to help.
Okay any other board comments anyone?
Vice chairman Wells.
Chairman I move the way adjourned.
To adjourns our second second any discussion all those in favor I will stand adjourned we thank
everyone for their time attention and their input.
