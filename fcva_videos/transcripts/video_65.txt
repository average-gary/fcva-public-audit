I will ask that you join me in a moment of silence and also during the moment of silence
we remember our former commissioners no longer with us Mr. Larry and Brogie at this moment
of silence please thank you before I move on I will say just a few words about Mr.
Brogie I'll slide down this little bit sir I can be close to the mic I will say a few words about Mr. Larry and Brogie
he's a dedicated little servant public servant to his area he served on our numerous committees with us in the planning commission and his passing was a shock to us all so we do have an open seat we will have
I was briefed our monitor our next meeting two weeks from now to honor him with a resolution so again keep his family and himself and your
else prayers I would appreciate that thank you the next item on our agenda is the adoption of the agenda there's no changes to that I'll take a motion to adopt motion to adopt all those and all those in favor
I thank you the next one we have is two items is under our meeting minutes we go for approval of our meeting minutes the first one is for the
August 5th 2020 beauty minutes that we have no changes to those minutes as they were printed all about to accept a motion to adopt those motion to adopt the August 5th
minutes second all those in favor thank you the next one is the August 16th 2020 minutes but there's no changes to those minutes of the
motion to accept those motion to adopt the August 19th minutes second all those in favor hi thank you so much our next item is our committee reports and our first up is Mr.
Bowen with a comp grant committee thank you Mr. Chairman the complaint committee met on September 14th we had two items on the agenda which are also items on
this evening's agenda the waverly farm sewer and water service area expansion request which was a proposal ultimately to include 171 acres in the swaza and also an amendment to the 2035 comprehensive plan to the northeast land use plan to expand the sewer and water
service boundary or to make adjustments to that boundary kind of to right size it and which has a net increase in that process of 335.43 acres and that's inclusive of what would be adjusted for
waverly farm these efforts are both endorsed by the committee recommended that they be approved and these were also done in close collaboration with the planning process for Frederick water so again those
were on this evening's agenda next one is myself the committee chair is not here tonight of the DRC so I'll just go down briefly if you bear with me we met on Thursday the September 24th and discuss the two following items the water supervisor the doctor to the ordinance amendment to expand the definition of daycare facility to include adult care adopted adult care also at least was adopted on September 23rd
and the second item was discussed at that meeting was opposed to ordinance amendment from a citizen through the water supervisor's representative to allow chickens in the counties RP which is our residential performance zoning district discussion of the amendment also include the discussion of supplemental use regulations to address screening noise and odors from such use this item will come before the planning commission for discussion on the October 2nd planning commission meeting I think that date is wrong I think it's October 20th I think it's October 21st
so thank you for that and that takes care of that and I'm going to change spaces I'm out now the transportation committee representative they met this past prior Monday that was October 5th there was three things that that came for the committee there and I believe one of them was to calm calming striping in the Ravens and Odell crossing to help alleviate some of the speed and parent issues are having a transportation traffic and that
subdivision the next one was announced was a right 22 relocation update all this we would add us to route 522 south overall pike area over by the Costco area over there in the last one they they spoke about they made announcements and be no transportation form for the general public due to COVID and some other issues this year
so moving right from that bear with me as I give you a quick and down and dirty update on the transportation county water report the new water treatment plan is soon to be under contract and up and started contract the design is 60% complete and they're moving full with the new water treatment plant and the swaza and connections and the northeast land use plans with sonar genus night was also discussed at that meeting so that's what happens when we have numerous members
members not here it's like you get my smiling face so to give me a break now I'll go to the Winchester Planning Commission liaison Mr. Mark Loring I believe he has a report of course
thank you Mr. Chairman Mark Loring yesterday the Winchester Planning Commission reviewed 11 action items three rezoning requests two site plan reviews three conditional use permits and three text amendments I'll just highlight four then
two of them I think you might be interested in the first of the rezoning in the former Frederick County middle school site from low density residential low density residential with a plan units development about 314 units somebody's come in and they've got a pretty interesting looking plan next is a site plan for a royal farms gas station on Burville Avenue where the old pizza hut is right now
the third is to relax a tech relax the ordinance on keeping chickens in the city so you might be interested in to see what we're doing there we'll take action on that two weeks
and last is a site plan for the former Sarazane firehouse somebody wants to redevelop and that looks pretty good too thank you
thank you Mr. Chairman nothing to report from the board supervisors however on behalf of the board and being on the representative of the board
like to pass along my condolences to the Larian Burgee family and close personal friends he did a lot to serve the residents of this community in county and thank him for his many years of service
thank you sir I appreciate it
can everyone still help me hear me and the fact that we're good shape all right our next item is our citizen comments portion
let me make a brief announcement on citizen comments uh procedurally we do not have public here tonight
we had our public hearing for the tipping industrial park rezoning we had that 60 days ago
we do not allow citizen comment portion to be a public hearing so that being said we have got your correspondence we have got all your information
your your emails and your religion your desires with the tipping industrial park rezoning we understand that unfortunately procedurally wise we're bound by those that we do if I ask for citizen comments
please do not get up and speak on the tipping industrial park rezoning the citizen comments is for anything that's not on our agenda tonight
and unfortunately that is on our agenda but it's not a public hearing item that public hearing now you will have your chance at a public hearing at the board of supervisors meeting will be your next form that you can get up
express your desires your complaints you know what have you like that at the public hearing at the board of supervisors meeting so I just want to clarify that there was any misunderstanding
so it's his time open citizen comment portion so if anyone would like to speak to us about anything that's not on the agenda there's not one of those three items on there this is your time to come forward
you know what I already thank you
here's the reason that he's a little bit more patient as it seems he's actually right that you're going to be able to develop an opportunity on that comments
so just not this meeting and I'm sorry that's just how the procedures are I didn't write the procedures I'm just trying to follow and best I can
but that's not it all and you're saying we don't want to appear that way but it's just where we're just following procedure now what usually happens and I'll address everyone again is that when we get the changes that come forward tonight that don't mean what's going to that we'll address tonight we'll go to the more supervised it gets tweaked again so what you want to see is maybe a different version even again
so that being said I understand your your comments and I'm just trying to follow the procedures I'm sorry
I'm going to close this in comments I'll go right to the action item on our agenda which is the reason zero two-twenty I got this program
thank you Mr. Chairman members of the commission this is a rezoning request for 19.8 acres to be rezoned from the R.A. Royary's district to the B3 industrial transition district with proper
proper as you may recall the Pippin property is located on the western side of Route 11 South adjacent to the Apple and sports property it is also situated south of the limits of the Bartonsville historic area
now you may recall this item was postponed for 60 days at your August 5th meeting so tonight we're back in front of you with the applicants revisions and to discuss this project again
so just just for reference the location map for the properties on the screen to your left it fronts Route 11 and as you can see it the Apple and sports property is that one to the south
so just to kind of a little history back from when this was first considered the commission discussed a number of concerns from the initial application
the consistent of comments regarding the intensity of the use about the requested B3 district and conformance with that in the comprehensive plan which calls for general business uses
there's also discussions on the buffering from Route 11 for the adjacent properties due to the visibility and topography of the site and then the screening of outdoor storage
visibility from the residential properties in the historic Bartonsville area as well as concerns about accessibility to Springdale Road
now since the August meeting the applicant did submit a proper statement revised dated September 4th I'm just going to kind of go through those bullet points of what has changed and then following that if there is desire by the commission I can then go through any of the other information from the previous discussions
so first some of the changes include there's a right away increased dedication for Pippin Lane should it be needed in the future should the Steven City bypass need to be relocated from the southern from the Apple and property a little south to this property
they have offered to not allow any traffic from the development to access Springdale Road there will be no parking or buildings within 250 feet of Route 11 they are also proposing a woven fence that would kind of run along that 250 feet in order to really kind of enclose that area so it would be able to grow up in the future
there's no outdoor storage permitted between Route 11 and the rear wall of the nearest building all outdoor storage that is along the that faces the northern property boundaries will be screened by a six foot fence or bomb
the existing trees and vegetation in the shared fence line of the northern property bounty will remain undisturbed and they also did proper maximum building square footage of no more than 35,000 square feet
and they've also to the list of prohibited uses included gas stations laundry and labor unions such as summary of the changes and then the revised general divide generalized development plan does show the road locations the buffers the additional right of way that is proposed
so that's really like I said it's just a summary of the changes if there's any desire I can go back through the full list of proffers as well as what the comprehensive plan for the current town area plan discusses
so questions Ms. Parkinson's
Ms. Parkinson's have they committed to incorporating the B dot comments
transportation and Mr. Bishop is here for any discussions about the transportation portions of it they have discussed the road construction and
as well as the phasing of it with the new proffers
so the new proffers do address all of the V dot comments because there were a lot of comments by V dot
Chip I'm not sure where
like I said I do want to defer transportation to the expert
I can pull up that section if you want
Yes, frankly my understanding is that even the previous comments had already addressed or the previous proffers had already addressed concerns with V dot regarding entrance location and all that sort of thing
so we were we were comfortable from the V dot perspective with with the proffers already so that those should be fine
transportation stamp
how would they enforce that?
frankly it would be for us to enforce at subdivision and site plan we wouldn't be allowing them to show a connection to the neighboring property
I admit it's somewhat in the eye to be older it's a bit difficult to enforce but that is where we would handle it as far as the department and also I mean frankly you're talking about a commercial development with a direct access to 11
take kind of a special individual to go through a back road that's not been allowed to be developed to go on to another windy narrow road to get back to 11
the property behind the 75 acres is right next to springdale roads that concerns me a little bit
considered I was out there this afternoon and just about got run over by a dump truck just passed the Anderson's front yard on springdale road
luckily there was a place for me to get off into the ditch and into an area where he didn't hit me
and that's one of those things that as we proceed with the Renaissance drive project that's going to be a cul-de-sac on the springdale roads
on the rather the east side of the railroad track as well which frankly is going to make it that much less desirable
yes I'm not as far as transportation
total vehicle trips per day not to exceeds 646 how's that controlled monitor and what happens if it exceeds that
once again that's something that would actually get worked out as the site is developing using ITE trip generation rates for the proposed use
any other questions Mr. Joe the springdale road that's already in the proper that they will not use that
but there isn't there also they'd have to build a bridge or something to even get back there on springdale from the property
I believe they actually could technically go through the adjoining property and access
the adjoining property does have access to springdale road via just a normal driveway I believe it's a shared driveway with another neighbor
my comment earlier just had to do with I just don't see that as being a reasonable path
and I'm not trying to in any way set aside the concerns of folks who brought that forward
it's just if I'm going to a business on this road that has direct access to Route 11
it's very difficult for me to picture going all that way around to go to frankly a less desirable road
in the 646 that's for vehicles period right now for just all trucks for vehicles
okay just want to clarify that one too and that's different from you'll notice in the profit there's a design standard that refers to a higher number
but that's basically referring back to a V dot design standard that's different from this trip generation restriction
okay thank you anyone else?
I don't have any question for you Mr. Bishop thank you
how much pet can't if I may and may have to ask the applicant
we're dealing with 19.9 acres 20 acres basically
how many acres is out there total that could be on that we could be looking at something like this again down
in a few years and this is just a tip of what we're starting with out there
I referring to the back parcel I honestly do not have the acreage of the back parcel
and just given looking at this map I mean this this piece itself is 19 acres so you're looking at a good bit larger
I have a location map that actually shows the aerial a little better that's a zoom in so sorry
I guess you can see the back property goes back a good ways but I defer to the applicant to see if he has the actual acreage of the adjoining property
okay thank you
no sir there's no questions from the audience I'm sorry thank you
any other questions miss Parkinson's?
I've got a question Mr. Moly the comprehensive plan shows this as R.A. right now
and it could be moved up to general business which would be B2 zoning
but we are considering moving this to B3 is that correct
the current town area plan calls the for the property of the general business
which is B2 which would be consistent when you look at the zoning ordinance of the B2 business general districts
so the property is currently zoned out rural areas the applicant is asking for a rezoning to the B3 industrial transition district
okay any of the other property that's touching this 19 acres
would it have to go through this same process to be brought into the B3 or to be considered for B2
any property that wishes to be rezoned would one have to meet the intent of the comprehensive plan
so within that area if you look to the screen which would be to your right as you can see that's a kind of a snippet of the
current town area plan for this property that orangeish color is the general business
and then you have north of that the developmentally sensitive area which is the Barnesville area
so this is not consistent with the comprehensive plan that's what I'm saying if we're asking for B3
I just that's all I need to say
thank you sir
there's a platinum or package that shows the parcel 75 has been 75 acres partial to the rear
tax back 74 75 is 75
thank Mr. Mangard I'll see that now so that okay
thank you any other questions Ms. Perkins
thank you with the applicant Mr. Stone who'd like to come forward please
leading Mr. Chairman commissioners
I'll be brief and summarize the changes that have been made as a response to comments that we heard from both commissioners and citizens
the last time I was here representing Mr. Gregory with this project
first the springdale road we've talked about that a little bit
our intention is to prohibit the connection to springdale road that's not practical
feel like the floodplain if you look at the terrain why would anyone want to drive back there on a curvy windy road
it's really is a difficult road this Roger you found out this afternoon I used to live back that way I understand
what's really interesting is to see a low boy on the railroad tracks when the train's coming
the traffic volumes as was mentioned by Mr. Bishop the 646 trips per day is total traffic
generally speaking that's average is nationwide about 8% of that would be trucks
which ranges from the UPS truck to tractor trailers it's not all tractor trailers
okay there's employees there's customers a variety of other traffic that happens there
and our last meeting the planning department expressed in concern about a single large building that may go there
and be quite honestly visually on appealing so we've limited the size of building to 35,000 square feet
that enables us to put multiple buildings on the site but as we've looked at the terrain
we don't believe the buildings in the rear will be visible because of the view shed and the angle of the from Route 11
and we have a profile of that which I believe Ms. Perkins has and we can look at if we if we so choose
again the as I mentioned before Pippin Lane is not code linear with the Steven City bypass
they're two different roadway projects and they're separated geographically
we have agreed to reserve an additional 30 feet of right away along Pippin Lane
should it be decided by this body and by Steven City that that should become the Steven City bypass
at some point of future so we've accommodated that
the buffer along Route 11 was a question last time we offered an option for a 50 foot landscape berm or 150 foot natural vegetative buffer
as Ms. Perkins mentioned we've increased that we've gone to a 250 foot natural buffer
I mean that's almost a football field and it encompasses about three acres of land
there will be stormwater management in the midst of it but the goal is to preserve that
so that it's natural and we'll blend in with what we see in the Bartonville historic district
outdoor storage was a concern the last time we were together and the visibility of things will be around these buildings
whether it's equipment or vehicles or construction equipment or whatever it might be
so we've added a proper that says hey everything's got to be behind the building this closest to Route 11
and we'll put an opaque fence up the six feet high to screen as much of that as possible
we also heard comments of B3 was too intense for this area
and we've proffered out additional uses to try to mitigate that concern
I will say if you look at some of the B2 uses I mean we're talking general business here
there's motels restaurants and other things that would be a much more intense use than what we're proposing
bars hotel shopping grocery stores that would generate tremendous amounts of traffic far more than what we're proposing
so we think this is the appropriate way
there were comments about visual aspect from Route 11 again we think based on a profile that we've looked at
the front building is going to we're going to screen those that are behind it
because of the terrain and we think that would be beneficial
the comprehensive plan was recently updated
and the historic overlay for Bartonville and the Kernstown plan
and areas outside of that were designated for his commercial development
so it's clear where that historical district ends and the commercial begins
and it's interesting on the north side there are areas that are designated in the comprehensive plan for commercial
and there'll be three uses to the north of this Bartonville district
and I don't know of any problems that have existed from
for example shine trucking or some of the businesses up that way
so we've tried to take all these things into account and that's a brief summary of how we've
how we've gone about that and I would be glad to answer any questions that that you might have
any questions Mr. Stone
Mr. Joe
circling this back the purpose of this is for Mr. Gregory to move his business on this property
is that correct that is that is yes he wants to move his business here yes
in order to do that it has to be B3 correct
okay so I just wanted to confirm that
yes sir
you say it's for Mr. Gregory to move his business on the site and understand it has to be B3
but in his proper he has left the large number of items
that would be allowed on the property
that really aren't needed for him to move his business here
the ones that you've profit out for the most part you wouldn't put there anyhow
so if it's just for Mr. Gregory to move his business here
why haven't you profit out a lot of the other uses that are allowed on a B3 property
that wouldn't be needed for him to move his business here
as I said earlier in response to a discussion we had at the last meeting
rather than one large building we're going to put multiple buildings and limit those to 35
thousand square feet so we want to have the flexibility for not only Mr. Gregory
but maybe complementing businesses to come in as well in some of the other buildings
I understand
that doesn't really answer my question because complementing businesses
there's still a lot in B3 that wouldn't be considered complementary businesses to his business
so that leaves a big opening there
it gives him flexibility as well as does
yes
thank you
Mr. Staud, describe a little bit this woven fence
are we talking just like a chain link fence or are you talking about American wire fence
type like you said
tell me about American wire fence that would not be visually obtrusive
so we look more and nothing more like a bit of pasture down below and that is correct
that is correct
if you like I probably did with rice everyone else to refresh
on memory of being here on your life
that lamp pretty much was not going to be used for anything anyway for developmental purposes because the way it lays
so we're really not talking about a big sacrifice here
and what it does is it allows the vegetation to grow up the trees to grow up
which will provide additional visual buffer for metal
I think that's the benefit of it
it's about my black hair and the color of yours that vegetation could grow for our life times again
and I get tall enough to obscure them buildings on that elevation
that I'm looking at today
back there
and I would have to be some fast growing vegetation
so it's a little disheartening that that's in there
then it really does nothing other than it's a drop by a type of situation
but I understand what your intent is on that
so
thank you
any other questions?
just a clarification Mr. Stowe
just to confirm the the limitation on square footage is for any one building
so the total square footage for the site's not limited to 35,000 square feet
it's that no single building will exceed 35,000 square feet correct
that is correct yes
thank you
thank you
this is an action item it's a discussion item
also so that means
we have comments and discussion among the commissioners
so at this time if anybody have any other comments or questions they'd like Mr. Thomas
I'm a little concerned about this
I agree I do not think this is in accordance with the comprehensive plan
and once we if this would be rezone to be three
that sets a precedent
that the all of the areas around it can be rezone to be three
because if we rezone this
what what reason will we have to turn down
adjacent properties being rezone
I look at this as being a very
piecemeal approach
we're talking about 20 acres
and there's another 75 or 70 acres behind it
that I have no doubt once this is rezone
it will come in to be rezone
which is a significant development
now yes the area behind maybe the neighbors wouldn't
wouldn't see as much
but if we're going to do this I'd really like to see the whole package
and not a piecemeal approach to rezone this
rezone at the B-3 he needs the B-3 for his business
but if that's what he wants it for
the uses he has profored out
really are immaterial
and there are significant uses that he has left in
that will really alter the character of that area and change that community
I don't see how they're going to monitor the traffic to springdale road
yes they say it's impractical for the traffic to go to springdale road
but it was impractical for that dump truck that almost ran over me
the day to be on springdale road too but yet there they were
so I'm not sure that does this much
as you mentioned the 250 foot buffer in the front
that area in the front's not economically developed or any house
that that proper is sounds nice but it really isn't anything
that yes we couldn't develop that any house so
we'll profit this to you
the addressing the V.comments I'm still not real sure about some of the transportation
comments I do not know how they will monitor
the 646 trips per day I mean is that going to be staff
V. it's not going to go out there and count cars
I don't know how they're going to keep traffic off springdale road
traffic safety there is a significant issue
I just do not think this is consistent with the comprehensive plan
now maybe I could be convinced if for B3
if they came in with the whole hundred acres or the whole area
that will come in in the future at some point to be developed
and profit out a whole bunch of other stuff
but this isn't where it would need to be for me to consider it to
satisfy factory I do not think this is
what we had in mind in the comprehensive plan when we developed it
Thank you Mr. Thomas. Anyone else? Mr. Moe
I just want to basically second commission or Thomas'
comments I think and earlier what Mr. Moldins said
I feel like there is a disconnect here with the comprehensive plan
you know it may seem subtle in some ways
that oh it's going from B2 to B3 or you know some version of commercial
but I think it's important it's significant
I do feel and I mentioned it I think at the last meeting that
the first step in this process if it was going to go in this direction was really to look at the area
and its totality and look at it as a comprehensive plan amendment first
so that we could kind of get our arms around it and understand how it would fit
I also feel that when it's a property on the edge of a development area
or a developable area and you have this developmentally sensitive area
immediately joining it that I feel like the level of
expectation for design commitments goes up you know so
while I appreciate some of the efforts that the applicant has made
to try to address some of our concerns I don't feel like it really gets to that point
I would feel the same way frankly if it was a B2 request
that we would be looking for that and similarly if it were B2
I wouldn't think it would be able to be two uses that would necessarily be appropriate
this is a unique spot so I think we need to be careful about that
we consider it but as of now I still have
a lot of concerns I couldn't support it
Thank you Mr. Mon, anyone else?
Joe, well
I think there's one of the issues here is
you're telling a businessman
you can't develop on your property
in order to develop on this property it's got to be B3
so that's an issue in itself
I know I understand the comprehensive plans B1, B2
but by the same token Mr. Gregory has made it clear that he wants to move his
business there in order to move his business there it needs to be B3
Now, Roger, I'm not discreet about the property you know
they could strike and really to be a good neighbor
that would be the right thing to do is to come back and strike
things that will make the citizens happy and make make us happy
but in the end day I'm just about a small
business is trying to do something
so I really think that that has to be taken into consideration here
Thanks sir
Evan
My concerns are exactly the same as Roger's
I just think I'd rather see the whole thing done
at this particular time so it doesn't come back later on
to Honus
and just a little caveat
35,000 square feet
we came visualized 35,000
can any of us
but picture a 70-foot wide
500 feet and it shows you what you have
that is a heck of a building
Thank you sir, anyone else
don't forget my three members on the floor
do you have any comments
I'll just make a quick one
I echo exactly what the three commissioners to my left have said
I think that the devils and the details a lot of these
and not ever cite as right to relocate a business
a lot of business people have a lot of options
and this probably is not his only option either
and it doesn't fit with our comprehensive plan
whether we have a comprehensive plan that's a 100% accurate
if anyone in this room is a 100% accurate
step forward they can set up here with us
but I don't think our comp plan is
this one here just doesn't fit
I don't think anyone realized in the late 70s
or even probably in the late 60s when it first was initiated
at Stonewall Industrial Park
those trucks would eventually be going down well-town pike
and then we have the trouble and well-town pike
that we have now over there
that thing is grown and is built out
that said springdale crossing is this current form
you cannot access it because of the railroad crossing
and my experience in my years of being in the development
and industrial areas
that soon will change
they'll go into the next
I have a feeling they're going to go to that next acreage
they're going to access well on the other part of what
and we'll be fighting the same issue again
so I still have problems
I think some of the profits that they did make a
valent effort to there
I do echo a lot especially Mr. Mone says
when we are in these sensitive areas like this
we have to make sure that we go above and beyond
and we see that a lot in the rezoning
whether we like the
standards that you want to see there
and this when you see that area out there
it just doesn't lend itself to this use
and to this high intensity
now is it an industrial park
that's up for debate
whether they used to write terminology
but that's the terminology we got in front of us
and so just
they go back in history a little bit
how things evolve
and I think we are at a precarious place with this
when I think
that other 75 acres concerns me
also
that's my two cents and with that
if no one has any other comments
this is a back creek district
and I'll entertain a motion
that we approve the rezoning of application
number 02-20
do I have a second?
second
I have a motion to approve
and I have a second
and I'll do the voting
start with Mr. Mold
if you don't mind
Mold and No
Morrison No
Don't know
Trump let No
Thomas No
yes
yes
and a chair votes No
the motion is failed
this will go to the board of supervisors
Mr. Chairman
I'm sorry
it would be appropriate to have an affirmative motion
even if that is a motion to deny
okay thank you
thank you sir you're exactly right
just don't entertain a motion
I'll take Mr. Joel off the hook
I make a motion that we recommend
the denial of
this rezoning
application
I second that
I have a second
and I'll put Mr. Joel right back on the hook
I'll have him go first
but Joel
no
Tom is yes
but yes
Morrison yes
Mold and yes
and a chair votes yes
so
now it can move towards the board of supervisors
thank you
thank you
and that goes for public hearing on October 28, 2020
thank you
thank you all very much
thank you
thank you
we'll let everyone just kind of
clear and we'll go from there
do you have the next one
okay
huh
well they don't put your name on it anymore
they don't put the names on it anymore
yeah
all right moving on to our next item
surprise you whoever stands up
I'll try
say hello
our next item on there is an information discussion item
it's see PPA
0
1-20 for Waverly Farm
sewer water extension
thank you Mr. Chairman
members of the commission
the Waverly Farm Comprehensive Plan Amendment request
is a request to expand the boundaries of the sewer water service area
around four parcels of land
the request includes 145 acres
and the site is located west
and adjacent to interstate 81
south of Hopewell Road
in the Stonewall Magisterial District
and I'll just top to the location map
real quick
the subject properties that are being requested
with the comprehensive plan amendments
are on
shaded in this kind of green hatched area
if you look on the map to the other side
we have interstate 81
this area
and then as you can see
this area is located
on the surface area
currently kind of bubbles around the interchange
so the properties are currently zone
R.A. rural areas
utilized for agricultural purposes
and as I stated on this one
the sewer water service area
in this area does encompass
about 51 acres
of that area
and
so what they are seeking is to include
the bulk of their land that they own
the sewer water service area
so I would note that
during the review and discussion of this
what is being shown
in the maps presented by staff as well as
Frederick water is a slightly larger area
of the boundary
really just to create more of a consistent line
for the area
so it would go from
the applicants request of the
145 acres to about 171 acres
so what if you can see
the applicants request as I say
is that green area
so there was this little kind of triangle area
that was left out
so it was just really bumped
along the main road to
just go around that entire area
and so what you see on
this map is Frederick water
was a big part of this
study with Waverley as well as
northeast land use land swase
so as you can see
this is Frederick water's map
for the recommended swase boundary
so it is consistent with
what is in front of you tonight
showing that 171 acres
with the plan amendment
staff is also proposing
text for appendix one
in the northeast land use plan
I would note that
the plan does not currently contain text
for this area
so what we are trying to do with that text
is to provide assistance
from the water management
and the maintenance of
the sewer water service area
its relationship to economic
development planning
and the recognition for the
need for funding of infrastructure
for improvements in that area
should properties want to
develop in the future that may come
to the sewer water service area
it is really guiding text
so that they understand that
history of where this has been. Originally, the Comprehensive Plan Committee discussed
the proposal that was submitted by the June 1st deadline at the July 2020 meeting. They
did recommend further study of the Waverly Foreign Amendment. It went to the Joint
Planning Commission Board of Supervisors' work session in August, where they did direct
staff to move the item forward for future's further discussion. Frederick Water was also
studying the request, following that work session, and then their board adopted what is
called the recommended Suaza Revisions in the Rattle of the North Corridor. They approved
that at their September 5th meeting, and that was really an analysis of the entire North
East Langer's Plan Suaza. It also included Waverly. So, with after following that, it went
to the September Comprehensive Plan Committee meeting, and the committee did recommend
approval of the Waverly expansion, totaling the 171 acres, as well as the text that is
proposed. So, with that, this item is presented for discussion. We are seeking comments and
recommendation for the Waverly expansion for the 171 acres, as well as the draft text,
and those comments and recommendations will be forwarded to the Board of Supervisors
when they discuss this at their October 14th meeting.
Any questions, Mr. Thomas? Ms. Perkins, do the property owners of that additional 16 acres
do they care if they're included in the Suaza or not?
They do know that they are included in the Suaza. We do send out a joiner notifications to
the applicants, and they will also be notified of the public hearing, but they are aware.
Does that change their property assessed values?
No, because it's still zoned agriculturally, so it does not change that portion of it,
only when they come in for a rezoning.
Anyone else? What say you? We like it? We move it forward?
I like it, I think. Do we need a motion or?
We don't need a motion. It's the information and discussion, so it's just a...
I think it'll make a lot of people not very happy.
I think it's going to be needed, so thank you.
Is that good enough? You got what you need?
No concerns about the text or the proposal. Good.
All right. Moving on to our next item then.
Our next item also is an information discussion item.
It's the 2035 Comprehensive Plan Amendment for the Northeast land use plan,
which ties right into the sewer water surface area. So, Mr. Perkins is up.
Again, thank you.
This next item, it's a discussion for proposed adjustments to the boundary of the sewer water surface area,
and this item is for the entire limits of the sewer water surface area for the Northeast land use plan.
So, this boundary review really focuses on the overall boundary.
It also examines areas that could be adjusted, either by being encompassed with an expansion
to be included in the sewer water surface area, or eliminated from the existing limits.
It also provided the opportunity to examine the boundaries and look at areas that the current line may not follow
property boundaries, because there are some areas, especially around the interchange,
where past land use plans have more bubbled around it instead of follow property boundaries.
And also with this, the Northeast land use plan text that was part of the previous item would also be part of this item,
because it would also apply.
So, this study was coordinated with Frederick water, and again, for that they did adopt the recommended
swasaboundary adjustments for that area.
Kind of the big items that were in the list of their adopted approved recommendations were removal of areas,
currently in the sewer water surface area, that would not require water and sewer service.
The addition of areas planned with a planned future land use that would require eventual hooking up to water and sewer.
Kind of a notation and an understanding that private investment in the infrastructure is going to be necessary.
And then for specific acreages, what they did recommend was removal of about 681 acres.
The addition of 1,017 acres, which shows a net increase in the sewer water service area of about 335 acres.
And I would note that they did focus a lot of their expansions on past comprehensive plan amendment requests that we have seen over the years that have been denied properties that have shown an interest in potential development.
So, the areas that are proposed, we have a couple of expansion areas, my arrow map, so I'll try to, we have the property.
It's the area one is up at the West Virginia border, rest church road area.
It's this kind of area that is outside of the kind of the bubble around the interchange for 81 and rest church.
That's the first area and then you have second area, which is the Waverly.
Third area is again on the eastern side of 81.
It was added to the Northeast land use plan number years ago, but remains outside of sewer water service area.
So that's this area.
And then the area for removal is this area here with a future planned extractive manufacturing land use because that used does not require public water and sewer.
So, I would note that there are two areas that are proposed or just shown as remaining outside of the sewer water service area that do have a plant land use.
It was discussed by the CPPC and they did, they did not recommend those being included with the study and that they should seek a future comprehensive plan amendment request.
They agreed with Frederick Waters kind of draft recommended adjustments because those properties have not previously come in for inclusion.
So if you can bear with me, this is that top area, rest church road.
There's this little middle section here that is not included and then kind of a little southwest of Waverly is the other area.
So, little application history.
It does follow similar time frame that Waverly followed.
It originally started out kind of as the Waverly Farm CPPA where the complaint committee did recommend further study of Waverly, but then they also recommended a further study of the Northeast land use plan.
Then when it went to the work session for the planning commission and the board, they moved Waverly forward, but then as a separate item.
They wanted to see a limited scope of just a swaza boundary review of the Northeast land use plan.
And then with that, Frederick Water then issued their recommendations and then comprehensive plan committee September meeting endorsed those recommendations and the text and then not including those choose parcels.
That we are seeking any comments that you may have to forward to the board of supervisors.
Again, what we're looking at is that addition of the 681 removal of the one thousand seventeen.
The Northeast land use plan text again, as well as the comprehensive plans committee discussion of not including those two parcels.
So plan just to questions and again, this will also go to the words October 14th meeting already.
Questions from Ms. Perkins.
One for Mr. Thomas.
No questions, but a comment.
I know this looks like it's an addition of 350 acres, plus or minus.
But really, it's an addition of a thousand acres because the 600 plus acres was never going to need sewer and water service.
We have significantly increased the area where we might have to provide sewer and water service.
So the practicality of us being able to provide that in the future could be pretty expensive to current Frederick County residents that depend on that service for sewer and water.
Yes, the developer is going to have to pay to develop put the lines in and that put the treatment plants and the water sources.
We don't usually get a lot from developers on those.
So let's not put her head in a sand and think that, you know, this is only 300 plus acres.
It's really an addition of a thousand practical acres or a thousand additional acres that may need sewer and water.
And by that little bubble that's not in there, we have another big area that again, because of precedence, why wouldn't that be included in the future?
You have the area north of it, you have the area south of it.
So if that comes in, I don't know what that was another 200 or so acres.
The precedent is there that if we include this, there's really little justification not to include that.
So we need to do this with our eyes open and not think that it's just 300 acres.
And when Frederick water has done their land planning, they really take the entirety of the acreage that's currently in the sewer water service area.
That's what they've typically based, you know, their capacities on.
So they have actually looked at that EM or extractive manufacturing as far as I wouldn't say reserved, but a understood, you know, piece of land that's kind of part of their whole.
And they also with their recommendations in their report.
They do have a number of bullet points of kind of understandings of these things are going to have to come online such as, you know, new plants, expansions and things of that nature.
Anyone else? Mr. Mon?
I just would, you know, I take your point. I think it's a good clarification.
And I think the important thing to keep in mind, too, is every piece of ground that's been brought in or being brought in as part of this adjustment into the Swaza has been planned.
You know, it's identified for a future land use.
It's not expanding our development area.
If you will, this is all area that we have anticipated through our prior planning efforts with the Northeast land use plan.
So it away.
What's happened is we're able to write size the Swaza with the input from Frederick water that we've never had before we've always had.
Well, you know, maybe we can serve it. We'll see what happens with the developer.
And now, which is a great place to be, we actually had a real study and a real coordinated plan.
And in a sense of how we can get there, because I think that was always our concern about should we go ahead and bump out the Swaza with this land use or hold back, you know, because we never knew quite enough.
So you're right. Absolutely that there are other downstream costs that I think are going to have to be considered.
But at the same time, you know, it really does align, you know, our infrastructure planning with our land use planning.
So I think that's a positive in the big picture.
Thank you, Mr. Mone. Anyone else?
Seeing no other has any more discussion. I think we're good with this.
I think everyone's nodding their heads and shaking the in agreement.
So I think we move it forward to the board also on the October 14th meeting.
And thank you, Ms. Perkins, for both those.
Of course, we have reached that part of our meeting was the other.
We will have a meeting on October 21st.
I'll take a couple items already on that right now.
I will also just remind everyone like we said earlier to keep the Brogie family and their thoughts and prayers.
He was a good law servant to us.
And with that, I'll entertain a motion to adjourn.
Do I have a second?
I'll second it. All those in favor of German.
All right. We're adjourned.
