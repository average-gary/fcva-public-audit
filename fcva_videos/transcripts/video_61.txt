She's done a wonderful job and she's willing to serve.

Thank you.
Economic development authority.
We have applications from Rick Till and Susan Brooks.
How would the board like to handle this?
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor Slotter.
Come back.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a motion to nominate Mr. Till and Ms. Brooks for the four-year terms and filling the vacancies that are now available.
The motion is our second in discussion.
Mr. Chairman, I sent a application out once it was received for Mr. Lofton and I would respectfully have to disagree with the two names that were mentioned.
I believe Mr. Lofton has served us well on the EDA and I think he would be a wonderful reappointment to the EDA.
So I will not be voting in support of the two names mentioned this evening.
I wish that it would have been added to the agenda as other things have been added to the agenda after the Thursday deadline.
And I'm a little at a loss as to why that was not forwarded out in an adopted agenda as it was redone as recently as yesterday.
So that's all I have to add.
Sir.
Anyone else?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I would like to do have three candidates.
Yes, if Ms. Lofton would be interested in a menacing motion and just make one and have an upper down, make the second upper down, the third upper down, and see where we are.
Or to have some type of a first choice, second choice, third choice.
You're welcome and I would accept a motion to amend the current motion on the floor.
So Mr. Chairman, I will make a motion to amend so that Ms. Lofton's first choice of Mr. Tellus is Mr. Tellus.
Give us to you want in your motion.
Mr. Tellus and Mr. Lofton.
Okay.
I'll second.
And a second.
All right.
Is there any further discussion?
Anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Mr. President.
I think that all three candidates are top-notch candidates.
And as I had a conversation with Executive Director of EDA, I asked him if we could just have, you know, create a third spot.
So I don't know how this vote is going to turn out, but I think all three candidates are great candidates.
And if a person is not selected in this round, and there's another opening on what that person, whoever is not selected, reapplies.
So they're all top-notch candidates, and so, unfortunately, we only have two openings and three candidates.
Further discussion on the amended motion?
Are we ready?
Surprise or Fisher?
No.
Surprise or McCarthy?
Hi.
Thank you, sir.

Excuse me.

Yes.
Item number eight, the EDA director requested discussion on the tax rate for data centers as follows.
$1.25 per 100 in assessed value, subject to declining values for depreciation.
The committee recommended approval.
There is a proposed resolution in your pocket and I would make a motion that we adopt the resolution for fiscal year 20.
I heard the motion is there a second.
Is there a second?
Mr. Chairman, I'll second with a point of discussion.
Thank you.
We're in discussion.
Supervisor Dyn.
On this motion here, the purpose of this motion is to try to bring in data centers which can be highly lucrative to a county.
This could be the case for the approved municipal tax rate or the Virginia or Loudon county or prime example of that.
So we have not had any request for data centers.
We seem to lose out early in the game and I've been told because of tax rates.
For that reason, I think Mr. Slotter said for just one year is that correct or for this coming year.

Hi.
Chair about its eye and emotion carries.
Conditional use permit 0920 Mr. Chair and welcome.
Thank you.
Again, Mr. Chairman.
This is a conditional use permit before you use for a request that construct a hundred foot telecommunicase's facility.
This proposed new tire is a tender replacement existing 90 foot tire which was constructed without a conditional use permit.
This property is located at 348 people lane.
It is owned R.A. rural areas is within the Gainesville Magisterial District.
The current land use is residential in the surrounding areas are residential and vacant respectively.
Again, our comprehensive policy plan of Frederick County.
So, this area remain R.A. and there is no study, a land study for this part of the county.
There is the outline of this.
It is in the sub division of the rural sub division and there is the outline of the property for this conditional use permit.
Again, this was applied in responsible zoning violation due to the construction of this 90 foot telecommunications tower on the subject property.
Without attaining a conditional use permit, the approval of the conditional use permit by the board supervises one avenue to debate the violation.
The applicant is seeking to construct a new hundred foot tower and is attended to replace the 90 foot tire that is currently on the property.
The applicant has secured and recorded a tower easement to the joining property which is just south of this for the purposes of the required setback for the tire.
I want that is Mr. Chairman. You had before this board for every foot you go up in the height regulations of the zoning district above that.
Every foot you go above the required height requirement, you have to go fall ratio.
The joining property owner allowed them through an easement to meet that buffcation.
This is the fall area just to show you that it has been recorded and the joining property owner has no issues there.
The zoning order allows for telecommunications facilities in the R.A. zoning district for the approved conditional use permit.
Should this facility be approved with the commercial telecommunication facility, we will be from the position to provide the existing and future land uses of this area that Connie with internet wireless needs.
For the record, Mr. Chairman, the authorities who moved into this property, the tire was already existing and we did get a complaint.
So they had moved in and now they're moving forward to try to clear that violation.
It had been there for some time as you know we do complain only basis and that's where this conditional use permit is in front of you tonight.
So should the board supervisors approve, find this use appropriate, the planning commission recommend the following conditions be assigned to this conditional use permit.
Number one, our review agencies and comments should be complied with it all times.
Number two, the tires should be available for a co-location or personal wireless service providers.
Number three, the tires should be removed by the applicant and or property owner within 12 months of abandonment of operation.

We have an expansion modification required a new conditional use permit. The planning commission again held the public hearing on August 19 and recommended approval of this conditional use permit following the public hearing staff is requesting a decision from the board supervisors requiring this request requiring on this request for a conditional use permit.
We are not sure if the property owners are here, but staff will be asked any questions that you may have.
Any questions of Mr. Chair? Anyone? Thank you. Is the applicant or the property owner here this evening?
Okay, so this is a public hearing. Would anyone like to comment concerning this post conditional use permit? Yes, ma'am.
We could have your name, magisterial, drastic and try to limit your comments to three minutes or less, please.
Yes, my name is Darla McCarrary. I live in the back creek, back creek creek area. I'm obviously not prepared to speak on this issue, but I cannot sit here and not let you know what I know about this, this subject.
I obviously came here for a different, a different agenda item, but I would like to make you aware that electro magnetic frequency, electro magnetic radiation is a very valid health concern, and this is the third tower that we're putting up in this area.
One of them is going to be near my children and my grandchildren's home in middle town. One of them is not so close to my home, so why am I worried about this? It's because of what I know about EMF's and radiation.
And you wonder how many of these towers, how many more of these towers we're going to put up now? Is it a valid concern that people need good internet service, but what are they willing to jeopardize their health for this?
Google it, do some research yourself, because we can't just electrify our community with 5G. We all know that's coming. There's been health issues related to 5G that are very valid.
I know that this is a revenue stream for homeowners. You can put a lot of antennas on those towers. Not only are they unsightly, nobody wants to live next door to that, but that's beside the point.
I care more about my health and I do that, but that's a revenue stream for the property owners, so how many more of these towers are we willing to put up and jeopardize our health?
Because each one of those towers could have 20 or 30 antennas, so I just want to let you know.
Thank you.
Is there anyone else who would like to comment concerning this application? Anyone? Seeing no one, we'll close the public hearing.
This is Gainesboro, Supervisor MacArthur.
Mr. Chairman, I would move for approval, conditionally experiment number 09-20.
I heard the motion is there a second and a second. Is there any discussion? Supervisor Graber.
Aye.
Supervisor Dyn.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye. Supervisor Slaughter.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Aye.
Supervisor Fisher.
Aye.
Super Chair votes aye and the motion carries. Mr. Chair.
Thank you again, Mr. Chair, and members of the board.
This is conditional use permit for you today. It's conditionally permit 0820 for a establishment of a special event facility in our zoning district.
The property for this conditionally use permit is located 1147 North Piper Road. It's in a back Creek Magisterial district.
The property is owned RA, rural areas, with the residents, rural and juices, and is surrounded by residential and vacant land juices.
This facility will be conducted on a 107 acre existing form, which includes a single family, the tax resident,
a open outdoor patio and a 2,400 square foot barn full weddings and other events.
Turn your attention to the map on your left. There's the 107 acre parcel was outlined in blue.
Now this conditionally use permit has been applied for in a responsible zoning violation that a special event was operated without an approved conditional use permit.
The conditional use permit by the board of supervisors is one avenue to obey this violation.
The conditional use permit was established a special event center for private events such as weddings and other event types such as birthday parties, charity events and family reunions.
This proposed use will take place again on a 107 acre form, which includes a single family tax resident, which is already there.
Again, the open patios, the 2,400 square foot barn, and the applicant intensive event host events for up to 250 people.
We'll provide a gravel parking area for guests. There's permanent rest room facilities will be installed, including a new septic system and a drain field.
The new preparation will be the catering companies with a future permanent cooking facilities.
The special event facility will be accessed via a private driveway off a north, powerful road route 600.
Turn your attention again, Mr. Chairman, board members. At the planning commission, just to give you a little history, the applicant had applied for an entrance permit.
There's an entrance right now on the farm. There's not will not serve this facility safely.
So if you look at the red circle, that is where the area that was approved for the entrance by the Department of Transportation, Virginia Department of Transportation.
And that's his entrance permit plan that has come in.
That was concerned at the planning commission, and it all had been brought up. They have met that requirement as you know, all review agencies have to be complied with.
So there's going to be part of the conditions as we go through, but this was something in your agenda. It didn't come late, but it wasn't actually, it wasn't actually shown at the planning commissioners where the applicant was working with V dot at the times.
I just want to bring that to your attention.
Now, should the Board of Supervisors find the issues to be appropriate, the planning commission recommended the following conditions be assigned this condition or use from it for a special events facility.
Number one, all review agency comments that could be complied with at all times.
Number two, an illustrious sketch plan in accordance with the requirements of Article 8 of the Frederick County zoning, which should be submitted and subject to approval by Frederick County prior to establishment of the special event facility.
Number three is special events facilities or events should, we shall start nor earlier than 8 a.m. and all events in related activity should be included by 11 p.m.
Special events may accommodate up to the not exceeding 250 persons.
The appointment staff sign with the Maxwell sign area not to exceed 50 square feet and not exceed 10 feet height will be permitted and in expense or modification of this conditional use permit require a new CUP.
The applicant is here.
The planning commission did hold a public hearing on this special event center on August 19 and recommended approval.
Now, with that note, as you've seen at your diast with staff report, there were other buildings, other, something was going to be added on to this permit.
The applicant, his request had removed a lot of them. That's why your conditions that I just read off had been modified.
I don't want to have any confusion if any board members was to chairman that you're seeing two sets of conditions.
I'll let the applicant can explain that a little more. If the applicant would have had added the extra cabins, extra event facility, it required an engineered site plan.
The applicant is aware of our special events facilities, depending on me, require an illustrious sketch plan.
If we would have the cabins out there, which almost be like a camp run, you're looking at more health department requirements, you're looking at more requirements for the Virginia Department transportation.
So the applicant has asked that to be removed. It has been removed.
So the conditions that I have just read out are the conditions assigned that is conditional use permit.
I just want to clarify, because I know the staff report came out and showed what we had that I wanted to confuse it.
Finally, following the public hearing, Mr. Chairman, staff is seeking a direction from the board supervised on this request conditional use permit.
For the record, Mr. Smith and his daughter are here to answer any questions you or any board members may have on this proposed conditional use permit.
And I'm here to answer any questions that you may have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Questions of Mr. Chair and anyone?
Anyone? Thank you, sir. Is there anything the applicant would like to add or are there questions of the applicant?
I have questions of the applicant.
Okay. Thank you. If we could just have your name, Magisterial District, for the record, please.
I'm having Linda Berg. I live in the Peckin District, but I'm representing our property in the Bakery District.
And I did. I wanted to clarify. I know we talked about 10 p.m. for with our neighbors.
And we did mention that with the commission as well. But since some people may be there cleaning up until 11, they put to 11, but we would have sound off by 10 p.m.
Excellent. That was going to be one of my questions. I've had a lot of input from the neighbors.
The thought process prevailing for most of your neighbors have been a 10 o'clock shut off for the noise and lights out by 11 to be respectful of them.
One other question that I have for you, it seems we've been a little slow in getting the lane in.
And that's been a big concern for the neighbors being where your current access road is presently.
I know you had an event on Saturday night utilizing your festival permit.
And I noticed the sheriff's deputy was there and he was very effective. I watched him work a while.
My concern is, is will this entrance way be put in sooner rather than later? It just seems like we've been dragging our feet. Maybe V dot's been holding us up.
Maybe the power company's been holding us up. I'm not sure where that stands.
I'm really interested in seeing that entrance way put in and seeing.
Some of the results of that, the dust, the noise, the lights, the neighbors may receive secondary to that lane being put in.
Really prior to moving forward, but I'd like to hear some feedback regarding you regarding your lane installation.
I know they did some clearing a couple of weeks ago and then Mr. Hawkman was actually on vacation last week.
So he didn't do much last week, but his plan was to get it in or at least get most of it started by the upcoming weekend.
Is there a completion date in mind?
Two weeks.
Thank you.
Any questions, anyone?
Yes sir. Supervisor Dun.
I was the one that asked you back in April, you know, whether you're going to have one item or two.
And so my questions are to you and to your father. And it's also for board members.
And the reason I want to have the conversation with you is because I don't want to make comments that then you when we have board comments say,
you know, that's incorrect, etc. So that's why I want to make some comments and then get some feedback.
My impression is that you and your family bought this property year and a half or two years ago, whatever you didn't.
And my impression is that it was bought with the intent of generating income from it.
It was not farming come. In other words, it would be special event income.
I know I had to talk with Mr. Sharon and he said to Mr. Smith, give us your wish list and that wish list included, you know, 12 cabins.
And that would break it into a campground type situation.
I'm wrestling with the issue that I want to preserve agricultural land in western part of this county.
And it achieves that. It's better than having lots of houses.
At the same time, the question I posed through my head is, is farming such that you cannot make a profit on schedule F.
And you have to do something else to sustain that. I've asked Mr. Thatcher to go and get me some information on how profit will not profitable farms are in this area.
So you don't have to answer the question, I will not be offended, but my questions are as follows.
Did you buy the property with the intent of farming it, cattle, grain, apples, etc.
Or was the intent to go and buy it because of a special event centers where probably until you can make $15,000 per weekend.
Sorry.
Okay. And is that such that, you know, you bought up.
No, you couldn't farm.
But wanted to preserve it to some degree versus farming. I guess that's my first question.
The original intent was farming cattle, Christmas trees, things of that nature.
But we quickly realized in restoring the original buildings, how costly it could be.
And the potential that we did have for events. So we do plan to maintain what we can of farming with cattle.
We plan to add cattle and Christmas trees and maybe even an orchard of some fruits and that kind of thing.
And we've also talked about conservation easement with some of the property as well.
So I don't need to get into your numbers, but you can do those and make, you know, $5,000, $7,000.
You can also have a farm that can make $50,000, $60,000, $70,000.
It's very difficult to live on 5, 6, or 7, and your husband may be able to live on, you know, 50, 60, or 70.
So Mr. Sherman, one of the issues that I'm just wrestling with here is, are we in a situation as a county where outside parties,
the outside party comes in, buys a farm, and then sets up a special event centers where our farms are going to be essentially special event centers items, which still preserve some of the land.
And that's the issue I'm wrestling with. And so it's not personal to you that that's the only way.
And then, you know, I understand what you're doing. If there's a way to go and make that into an agricultural area where you'd have enough income to go and generate income to live on, that's another item.
But you're not living on the farm, I understand your brother is. I think your father said that they have enough income to meet the mortgage payments without this, so not putting words is about, but that's what I was thought.
And so that's that's what I'm wrestling with here, Mr. Sherman, as a county, where do we go on future farms? Thank you.
Other questions at the app, can anyone? Thank you very much.
Is there anyone else who would like to comment concerning this conditional use permit? Yes.
You did have several folks sign up. I'm sorry, let's do that.
My fault. You'll want to just pull the microphone down. It'll do whatever you ask. There you go. Thank you. If we could have your name, match till district.
My name is Benita Brill. I live in the Bakery, Magisterial District. And I come before you this evening to respectfully ask your consideration to detain the approval of the conditional use permit for Canaan Springs Farm at this time.
My husband Tony and I live and own 155 acres on North Piper Road adjacent to Mr. Smith's farm.
We were notified and attended the August 12 meeting concerning the festival permit.
We were the only neighbors in attendance that night, and I contribute this to word spreading quickly that a subdivision could replace the event center.
That's supervisor grapeers assurance that we would have ample time to observe and weigh our options.
After attending that meeting, I just had the feeling that the board was given less than some straightforward answers. And I felt that the answers you got were more what they thought sounded best and what you wanted to hear.
We did not speak for against this permit at that time. We were trying to be fair and reasonable. However, a week later, Mr. Smith was before the planning commission asking to erect a new barn, three to four pavilions and 10 to 12 cabins, as well as asking to operate until midnight.
The buildings were quickly dashed from the proposal and Mr. Smith graciously scaled the closing air back to 11 p.m.
This was clearly not observed Saturday night. Fireworks were heard at 11 p.m. and 11 p.m. These are fireworks. It can be heard a quarter of a mile away inside windows closed television on.
As of today, of course, you know, the road, the main entrance and the signage remain unfinished.
There were two events held in August, one on August 15. There was a deputy there with his lights flashing for safety. I did not observe one on 822 could have missed it. There was a deputy Saturday night.
This new proposed entrance is straight across the road from one of our large property driveways. I just don't feel that the neighbors and the people of the community have been given a fair chance to see what impact this event center is going to produce and I feel that if their festival permit expires the end of the year, waiting the 90 days should be feasible.
We've been told that once a conditional use permit is granted that it will be very difficult for us to have any issues or concerns addressed or adjusted.
So I just ask for your consideration, please. And thank you.
Thank you.
Is there anyone else who would like to speak?
Louise Garrett.
Welcome.
Good evening. My name is Louise Garrett and I reside at 99 North Piper Road and I border Mr. Smith's northern property. His new driveway will be beside mine.
I believe that Professor Graber sent you my email and comments that I made. I did attend the planning commissioners meeting.
So you have some of my comments there as well as some pictures that shows the driveway has not been put in Mr. Smith's driveway.
I would just reiterate what Mrs. Brillett said we have no idea of the impact right now.
We don't have any idea of the light, the noise.
What kind of traffic impact that's going to have?
People fly on that road. It's 55.
You pop over that hill at 55 and there's two cars sitting there with that driveway as proposed and you're going to have a chain reaction.
There's just a whole lot of questions and I would implore you to give consideration for this CUP to wait 90 days, give us an opportunity as a community to experience and figure out what it really is going to look like.
We have lived in this quiet community for generations and generations.
It does startle us a bit to hear of pavilions and cabins and year-round events.
Yes, some of those things were taken off of the table a couple of weeks ago at the meeting for three to five years.
Then there'll be reconsideration. Once the CUP goes through, we will have a little ability as a community to stop anything unless there's a gregious violations.
So I would respectfully ask you to please consider a 90-day way to allow Mr. Smith to get his road built.
It allows us to see what the impact is. Thank you so much for your consideration.
Thank you.
Nicole Sweeney.
My name is Nicole Sweeney and I'm from the Back Creek District.
I live at 1301 North Piper Road and I border the south border.
So I'm all for businesses but I reiterate what Ms. Bonnie Pearl said and Louise Gart said about the noise and just a 90-day extension for things to get ironed out.
I have two children, a four-month-old and a five-month-old and I'm just concerned about noise issues.
We could hear the noise on Saturday night and inside our house.
I can again get my baby to sleep and we have a box AC so it's very loud.
And again the fireworks and just get something like maybe trees planted, first sound or whatnot but again respectfully.
Like you guys consider a 90-day postpone.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Scott McCartney.
Welcome sir.
Thank you.
Scott McCartney.
I'm in the Back Creek District.
I resided 866 North Piper Road about a half mile north of the subject property.
I talked to Mr. Graber earlier tonight and decided I would come out and support my neighbors as well.
I think we need some time to look and see what the impacts are going to be.
I have my professional experiences with VDOT and Road and Bridge Construction and I have some serious concerns about the traffic impacts to this road, especially if there's going to be alcohol involved on some of these events.
It's a narrow back road.
We've got blind turns and we've got 55 mile an hour people that do 65-70.
And somebody pulling out is on the borderline to be an under limit.
It could impact somebody's life.
It's just trying to get home from work or whatnot.
So I think we need to look at this a little bit further.
I would urge that you would also take that into consideration and give it the necessary time for the residents in the area that are going to be impacted this on a weekly basis.
Have a chance to really look at it and see what we have here.
Thank you.
Thank you sir.
Sue McCartney.
It was Sue McCartney.
Are you not speaking?
Okay.
That's all, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Anyone else who would like to speak concerning this application?
Anyone at all?
Anyone?
All right.
We'll close the public hearing portion.
It's back.
Creek.
Mr. Chairman.
I'd like to first thank everyone who's come out to speak and all the phone calls I've received.
I have gotten an opportunity to speak with 12 to 15 neighboring residents or folks who would be affected by this over the last three days.
And I appreciate the kindness that has been shown and the willingness to try to work with our neighbors.
It has been an overwhelming sense of togetherness and I've appreciated it.
The common theme that I've heard throughout is Mr. Smith has a festival permit.
Let's let him have the opportunity to be a good neighbor.
And if we were to table this CUP for 60 or 90 days, it would not affect his ability to continue to have events while also allowing time for the neighbors to see what works.
Well, what doesn't work well and just to have some dialogue before we were to move forward.
Just so Mr. Smith understands where I stand on this, I am very appreciative of the work that he's done to that facility.
I believe he truly wants to be a good neighbor and I am very appreciative of the respect that he has shown his neighbors.
So please know that coming from what I'm about to propose.
I would like to propose a 90 day extension that we bring this up at our first December meeting to allow Mr. Smith the opportunity to get his entrance way put in.
And also to have several events so that the neighbors would see the impact of the new entrance way and there can be appropriate dialogue associated with that.
That is my motion.
Okay, we're substituting a postponement for 90 days.
Instead of a short delay.
Sure.
We can postpone for 90 days.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's helpful.
Sir, second.
Second.
Second.
Discussion.
I think it's a good idea.
I'm very familiar with Pfeiffer Road in the back creek area.
All the comments are well taken.
It is very narrow road. People do speed on it.
And it does concern me when you have situations with heavy traffic, which this type of events that are will create heavy traffic.
I'm a road that's really not designed for that.
But the 90 day extension will at least give neighbors an opportunity to take a look and see which happen and give us an opportunity to see the new.
Egress and the entrance way put in and go from there.
Other comments, anyway.
All right.

I call Mr. D'Haven, these six weeks ago to try and rectify this problem.
He talked to people at the county.
I went to the builder and they agreed to reduce the lights until they left, which was
last week.
I was told that the county went out and monitored the lights after that and there was zero
at the railway tracks.
That is bull manure.
And I know that I was told that Mr. Sharon said the lights were on, the lights were
not on.
I went that day, I talked to Mr. D'Haven and the project manager, David Masters, agreed
to reduce 80% of the lights.
He did until about seven days ago.
Now the lights are back on.
He told me as soon as our project finalization is done, with nothing we can do.
This is a garden, mom.
If any of you don't know, you see a few flowers in here.
This whole plant should look like this right now.
They're out on the field.
There's no way I can shade them or stop the light.
That building that was built, unfortunately, I cleared that land.
I farmed that land.
Judy's family owned that land for years.
It was a farm.
I protested at being industrial, it didn't do any good.
But I cleared that land and it was down here, even with the tracks.
They went in and put 20 feet of fill in and instead of building a 20 foot tall building,
build a 35 foot tall building.
They have parking lot lights or 20 feet tall, but 30 feet up on the building, they have
these lights that project light all over the county.
I don't know what to do.
It's going to ruin my business.
I can't lose my Christmas crop.
That's what I pay my employees with all year.
I pay this county and since I've been in business myself, I have paid over $100,000 a year
in sales tax, which part of that goes to this county.
I pay it to the county.
I don't know what to do to get this taken care of.
Now I was told, I think Mr. David told me that until they get an occupancy permit, if
I can get something done, it'll be all right.
I'm asking you right now, those lights should be turned off until they get an occupancy permit.
They should not have permission until they have an occupancy to run all those lights.
And I need it now.
My crop of point set is in there now and they will be ruined.
And I don't know what to do.
I don't think it was appropriate what the county did to spend all the money to build Snowden Bridge.
Bridge, which the county and state funded over $4 million to build.
A road that goes to nowhere but a few industrial buildings.
But this county wants industry so bad.
Now, what are we supposed to do?
Why didn't it connect to Snowden Bridge?
The name of the road is Snowden Bridge Boulevard.
I am being told by the county that it may never connect to Snowden Bridge.
It should connect to Snowden Bridge and it should connect to Redbud Road so we can
stop the disaster area on Route 11, a short stacking distance.
If it went to Snowden Bridge to Old Charlestown Road at Snowden Bridge, then we wouldn't
have the problem at Route 11 and we're going to have a disaster.
They're going to put a light there but it's not going to, we have added so much traffic
that the residents of Old Charlestown Road in that area in Stevenson have to sit there
for 20, 25 minutes in the morning sometime.
But if they could get on Snowden Bridge Boulevard and come to 11 out of delight, it would
knock down probably at least 70% of that traffic and be more easy to access.
It should also connect to Redbud Road, which was initially I was told it would do.
And then we could close the early part of Redbud Road, connect 81 entrants and exit going
northbound and then we wouldn't have that stacking distance.
We would knock out the lights.
We would put right now the state has planning to extend 81 to three lanes, two exit 317.
If they stop it there, then you're going to bottle those two lanes in going over the
bridge because they don't want to redo the bridge and you got an entrance that's got
so much traffic traffic and we just added a 350,000 square feet building.
With 57 truck docks, there's two more huge buildings there.
What are we going to do about the traffic?
So it's all entertained in the same problem.
But I hope you all will consider this a little.
I've talked to the county about it a lot, I've talked to Mr. DeHaven about it a lot
and Mr. Slotter, but I haven't talked to some of the youth's others.
And I think that some of Mr. Dunn's comments about agriculture on things I would have liked
it seemed for darn on my side of the county too, not just somewhere else.
We need to protect agriculture.
You see what happened coronavirus.
Food was in shortages.
We need regional agriculture.
I always told my kids, if we had a truck strike, what would happen?
We can't say what people would be killing people for food.
We don't produce enough.
We've got to stop asking about the other point is like when all these industries, when
we had Amazon come in, everybody said, oh great, a thousand jobs, they were $11 an hour.
We subsidized the children's meals.
It wouldn't support a family on $11, but it stole every employee from small businesses
who were paying nine and ten.
They took the best, gave us back to try and get an employee in a small businesses county
right now.
But we're begging for more industry and we're building this building has no tenant.
It was built on speculation, so I'm asking you, please get them to turn the lights
out.
Thank you.
And the county is supposed to look at it.
Thank you.
All right.
Anybody having a question?
Oh.
Thank you.
Is there anyone else who would like to comment anything you'd like to share with the
board?
Anyone?
Last chance.
All right.
Mr. Chairman.
Public comment portion.
Yes.
If I could just share with the board, Mr. Chair and is going out to Mr. Weber's property
this evening to check out those lights and we will look into it.
I'm aware.
Two.
All right.
We're just supervisors, comments.
Are there any?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Weber.
We've never met before, but our family has done business for years.
We appreciate the business that you're running.
We know that you have a quality product, and we've used that quality product for
a number of years.
Your comments for the first time I've heard this, you've let a chat with your efforts.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You.
Anyone else?
Mr. Chair.
Mr. Weber, I would echo Supervisor Don's comments, and thank you for sharing this evening.
I also want to tell Mr. Chair and thank you for the hard work that you've done over
the last several months in my district and other things.
It has been a lot of work, a lot of phone calls, a lot of long days, and I appreciate
the efforts in which you've put forth.
I want to talk about three things specifically.
The first thing is as schools in the COVID-19 and the monies spent.
Soon after schools shut down March 19th, I had some conversations with my local school
board representative as well as the chairman of the school board, and I asked them what
their plans were with the anticipated savings from not having children in school every
day.
There was some discussion that they would get back to me in April while I followed
up with no response.
In May, I had a sit down meeting with Mr. Reformen, who is the chairman of the school
board, as well as my school board representative from Back Creek, who also echoed my concerns
on there were a lot of complaints from parents and grandparents in my district that there
were bathrooms that were out of service for six months to a year.
There were a lot of needs within some of the school buildings that needed to be addressed.
Some of those were even echoed by my local school board representative who had seen
the deficiencies in some of the schools that had been out of service for a delayed period
of time.
I'd ask for an idea of where those funds were and what those funds would be used for
in hopes that we would update and integrate some of the needs that we have been unable
to implement in our school system due to children being there the full school year.
As of today's date, I still have no idea where that money went, where that money has
been spent, what's happened to it, what improvements have or have not been made
where we are with it and it's pretty frustrating to me.
I was originally told it would take three to three and a half million dollars to be able
to do online learning and the things in which they are doing presently.
If you will look at the CARES Act and the things that are allocated there, there's three
to three and a half million dollars that is allocated for that type of learning and
can be used for that type of learning.
So my question comes back to the school board, it is a county's money, not your money.
I would hope that we as the board of supervisors who allocate those funds would be at
least be given the consideration to know where those funds went, to know that the facilities
who had dire needs are or were addressed and where those funds exactly ended up.
That is end of that comment, too additional.
I would like to congratulate Steve Mishack on the appointment of fire chief.
I think he's an honorable person, I've had an opportunity to speak with him and I think
that he will serve our county well.
It is my hope that he will help to restore integrity to within the fire rescue system in
Frederick County.
That is not a bash to the men and women in the field.
They work incredibly hard and I would like to thank them for their dedication and time
to this county.
However, I would like to follow up on a comment that was not included in the minutes of
tonight's agenda that was last month's meeting.
It was in regards to the closed session that we held here last month.
Part of the closed session meeting was to address some concerns that some board members
would like to see in the new fire chief.
There was a comment made by a supervisor, Fisher, that Sean Grayberg desire to have comments
regarding the appointment of the new chief that I should address them with the county
administrator.
I took those comments to heart and I appreciate the comment that was made.
That was August the 12th.
The night of the August the 12th before we left the meeting here that evening, I asked
the county administrator if I might have a meeting with him prior to the appointment
to lay out my concerns.
We agreed to come to a time to meet.
The appointment was scheduled for August the 26th for Mr. Tierney and I to meet to discuss
my concerns regarding the fire department and things that were of concern, I believe,
to the citizens of the county.
It was very surprising to me as you might be well aware that on August the 20th, six days
before our scheduled meeting, our county administrator chose to appoint a fire chief without
having or allowing input.
I believe that that is inappropriate.
I believe that if we are to be managers or supervisory staff of an individual that our
input should be included in the decision making process and I'm extremely disappointed
that it was not done, I would like to share a couple things I'm not going to get in
the weeds, but I would like to share a couple things that have occurred over the last
10 years in our fire rescue department that I think would maybe lend some credence
as to why there may be some direction or guidance given by the sport.
If we remember about 10 years ago, we had a fire chief who was arrested for drunk driving.
A year later, I came before the sport in November and spoke right there at the diocese
and asked for there to be an investigation into a fire department because there was
theft ongoing at the fire department.
Fast forward a couple of years and we had a chief officer of our career side make
an allegation against a member of the community that was proven to be unfounded, but they
were lies in an attempt to get a person removed or terminated from a position.
Fast forward 18 months from that position, we had another fire chief make another not
aged fire chief, but a chief officer of our career department make another accusation
about a cardiac arrest that occurred in my district.
Fast forward two years ago, two years ago, we had an additional fire chief representative
from the county, career side, all of these have been career side here, attempt to make
so that an individual who is a chief officer of a neighboring department would have difficulties
being on the Lord Fairfax EMS council.
Fast forward to the same year with the issues we had with a fire marshal and some decisions
that were inappropriate.
It soon leads credence to make a person on this board wonder if there shouldn't be
some guidance and some integrity restored within the fire rescue system.
It is extremely disheartening to me that we had an appointment of a new chief without
at least allowing for there to be input discussion and guidance given by board members.
I do appreciate Mr. Tierney allowing me the opportunity to meet with him, albeit a
week after his appointment.
As I stated previously, I am in full support of Mr. Mahshak, I wish him nothing but the
best.
I believe he has a good intent, a strong ability to do the right thing and to restore
integrity within the department at the chief operating levels and I believe the folks
in the field have for the most part had the utmost of integrity and the wherewithal to
work extremely hard through this COVID crisis and I appreciate the work in which they've
done.
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Anyone else?
Comments?
Anyone?
I have one question.
Mr. Margin, back to the school board thing, has school board member Monk, has he been
able to get you any, he said he had spoken to him, has he been able to get you any of
the information?
I mean, he's on the school board.
Supervisor Wells, thank you for that question.
Just to answer your question, school board member Monk has asked the same questions that
I have.
He's asked three times from school administration and from Mr. Foreman and according to my
conversation with him in the last seven days, he has also not been provided with that
information.
So it is concerning to me that the school board representative of my district is also
unable to get the same information that I am seeking.
Thank you for the question.
Comparison McCarthy, anything you'd like to share?
Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, sir.
Vice Chairman Wells.
Chairman, I move your adjourn.
Vice to adjourn, sir second.
Second.
All those in favor.
Vice Chairman.
Vice Chairman.
Vice Chairman.
