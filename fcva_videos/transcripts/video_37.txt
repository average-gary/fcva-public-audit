All right, I'd like to go ahead and call the meeting to order if we could, please.
Mr. President, will you leave us an invocation, please, sir?
I'd be happy to.
Thank you.
Let's pray.
Dear Heavenly Father, we come together this evening.
We ask your blessings on our county and our communities, on our state and on our nation.
We ask you to guide and hold our hands as we try to do the right things for all the people
that we represent.
We ask you to especially look in the hearts of each person to do what they can do to help our county and our community and our nation and our world.
Guide and teach us to be like you, to love one another, to be a part of the community.
Protect our firemen and our policemen, our personnel that are overseas, our personnel are there here protecting the homeland.
We ask all of these blessings and God's name.
Amen.
Amen.
And the pledge, sir.
Stand and face the flag, please.
A pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic, which stands, one nation, and the God, and the people, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you.
The adoption of the agenda.
How would the board like to handle that?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I'd make a motion to adopt the agenda with one amendment.
I'd like to postpone discussion of item number 12, planning commission, rezoning, Winchester Medical Center for two board of supervisors meetings to be put on the second supervisors meeting agenda in February.
Second meeting in February.
Yes.
All right.
You've heard the motion is our second.
I'll second it.
So any discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
I know that there are probably a lot of folks who showed up tonight to speak on this matter.
Okay.
Thank you.
Any discussion?
This is to move the medical.
To delay consideration until the second meeting in February.
Further discussion, anyone?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed?
No.
So we're removing that last item, which is 12a from our agenda until the second meeting in February.
Why is the agenda adopted as amended?
I am sure that there might be folks who came who wanted to speak to that item.
I would offer you an opportunity to do that now if you would like.
Is there anyone who would like to speak to that item?
We will be considering that item at the second meeting in February.
We're not going to consider it this evening.
Anyone?
All right.
We appreciate it.
Citizen comments, agenda items only.
They're not subject to public hearing.
Anyone sign up?
Mr. Ressler?
Mr. Ressler, sir.
We could have your name, Magistaral District, and try to limit your comments to three minutes or less, please.
You're going to have to get way more aggressive with it.
We'll stay up there for you.
Well, there needs to be that fixed.
Hello, commissioners.
I'm here.
I'm from Berkeley County, West Virginia.
As you know, there's been a resolution put forth in the West Virginia legislature to draft Frederick County into what is now West Virginia.
Virginia has become a part of West Virginia.
I do not know why you would even consider such a request.
I am resident of Berkeley County.
I am seeking a petition to have Berkeley County to commit Commonwealth of Virginia.
I am here to present constitutional proof that West Virginia in and of itself shall not be permitted to separate itself from the state of Virginia.
I ask you to read the attached document written by Sheldon Winston.
It confers the illegal
reality to form the state of West Virginia by the writing enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.
I shall give you a draft of this.
I wish to convene a convention in Berkeley County such as the one that was done in Wheeling
when it was Virginia.
I am here and now seek to file a petition by its citizens to have Berkeley County rejoined the state of Virginia.
To ascertain such and allow me to justify my actions, I hereby provide you with these facts.
West Virginia is either last or at the bottom 10% of the United States and poverty level education,
obesity, economic development, and opioid addiction.
Our infrastructure, roads and bridges are crumbling beneath us.
To West Virginia State Supreme Court Justices, the highest state judicial body was found to be guilty of corruption
and misappropriation of money in 2018.
The governor refuses to even live within the state capital of Charleston.
While you and this city have the legacy of Patsy Klein, we are left with humility by hill bellies
shows such as Honey Boo Boo.
Berkeley County West Virginia is an area which is substantial development access to Frederick County, Virginia,
as well as the rest of the state.
Our tax base is now burdened with shoring up the rest of West Virginia, which continues to fall into decline.
The economy based on coal and mineral wealth is no longer a viable substitute.
The population is in constant decline.
I employ the commission as well as all delegations and governmental bodies within the state to help me and many others who graciously seek salvation within your borders.
May other West Virginia residents in surrounding counties ensnared this movement and pushed forward to read all the outline of the commonwealth to include the many of us who wish to regain the proud heritage
and prosperity of your magnificent state.
Try to conclude if you would please sir.
I shall be awaiting a proposal from the Virginia legislators to honor my request so I may move forward with a petition
for the citizens of Berkeley County to sign and requisition to grant us a return to Virginia sovereignty.
May you all take my call seriously. Please be kind enough to carry me back to old Virginia.
If you'd leave your document with Ms. Phillips, we would appreciate it.
Anyone else sign up, Ms. Phillips?
Coleman?
Thank you. My name is Ed's Coleman and I was here to offer comment on item 12A which has just been postponed so I would ask just to defer my comments to that schedule.
Thank you.
Appreciate it. Anyone else, Ms. Phillips?
All right. Thank you.
Consent agenda. I would more like to handle the consent agenda.
Motion to approve the consent agenda as presented, sir.
Motion to approve is a second.
Second. Any discussion?
Supervisor Fisher?
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy?
Aye. Supervisor Slotter?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells?
Aye. Supervisor Dunn?
Aye. Supervisor Graver?
Aye.
The consent agenda is adopted as presented.
That will bring us to order supervisors.
Comments? Are they ready?
No, here we are. That's the one I was looking for.
Any comments?
Seeing none or hearing none, we'll move on.
County officials?
Supervisor Wells, if you would join me, please.
Employee of the month.
There we go. Thank you.
Please join us up here, please.
Well done. Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Are you ready, Bob?
All right. Well, on the other side.
Come on back over my way, please.
The camera gets a better view.
So the employee of the month resolution, Sheila Harden,
whereas the Frederick County Board of Supervisors recognizes that the county's
employees are a most important resource.
And on September 9th, 1992, the Board of Supervisors approved a resolution
which established the employee of the month award.
Candidates for the award may be nominated by any county employee.
Whereas the Board of Supervisors upon recommendation by the Human Resources Committee,
selects one employee from those nominated.
And whereas Sheila Harden, a member of the division of court services team
at the Northwestern Regional Adult Detention Center,
provided assistance for the majority of the workload for a full-time employee
who was idle medical leave from June 5th, 2019 to October 15th, 2019.
And during this time, Sheila did an excellent job working the front desk
in taking on a majority of the task assigned to that position,
as well as keeping her own job responsibilities in check.
Whereas in September of 2019, the division was informed by the commission on VASAP
that the old client database system would be replaced by a new system by the end of 2019,
requiring all active cases to be re-entered into the new system.
Whereas during the month of October, Sheila audited over 500 active case files,
an old system and working with the case managers was able to close services
for approximately 200 offenders, greatly reducing the number of cases
needing to be entered into the new system.
And whereas on more than one occasion, Sheila has taken on additional job responsibilities
to help the agency without being asked and without hesitation.
And over the last few years, Sheila has always been the first to help wherever and however she can.
As a dependable employee, Sheila displays quality work and leadership skills
and takes pride in her position with Frederick County Division of Court Services.
Now therefore, be it resolved by the Frederick County Board of Supervisors,
this 22nd day of January 2020, the Sheila Harden is hereby recognized
as the Frederick County employee of the month for January 2020,
and be it further resolved that the Frederick County Board of Supervisors extends gratitude
to Sheila Harden for outstanding performance, dedicated service,
and wishes her continued success in future endeavors.
Be it finally resolved that Sheila Harden is hereby entitled
to all of the rights and privileges associated with this award.
Please join me in thanking and congratulating Sheila Harden for a job well done.
Thank you very much.
Committee appointments.
Social Services Board?
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to make a motion to appoint Mrs. Sharon Grombling
to the Social Services Board for four years.
Second, any discussion? All those in favor, aye?
Aye.
Opposed, no?
Ms. Sharon Grombling is quite a blessing, is willing to serve, and has been appointed.
Planning commission, four-year term, Supervisor Grabe.
Yes, Mr. Chairman. First, I'd like to say thank you to Mr. Onger,
who has served for several terms. He's done a good job, had a good opportunity to speak with him,
and I've appreciated his service. I would like to make a motion that we appoint Dr. Mark Berg
to the planning commission for four-year term.
For the motion, is there a second? Second.
Second.
Is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor Dye.
I've known Mr. Dr. Berg for a number of years.
I think it would be a good member. He is intelligent.
He asks good questions, and so having someone in there that does his homework,
which he has done when he was in the state legislature, and he asks him questions,
I think would be an absent.
Thank you, sir, any further discussion?
The nomination? The motion.

No.
I'm sorry. Supervisor McCarthy?
No.
Supervisor Slaughter?
No.
Supervisor Wells?
No.

Thank you.
Public hearing.
Resoning 0-319.
Right.
Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.
This rezoning 0-319 for Berlin Steel Corporation is a request to rezone two pauses of land totaling
15.39 acres from the R.A. District to the M1 District.
This is in the effect of Magisteria District.
The subject properties are located south of 277, just on the east side of the writings Mill Lane.
And you can see the property is currently zoned M1 immediately to the north, which houses the
I and company, if you will.
And the properties that are highlighted in yellow are the two pauses to which they want to add the M1 zoning
classification.
The properties are located within the Southern Frederick Land Use Plan, and the 2035 comprehensive plan
identifies them for industrial land use designation.
Therefore, the proposed land use designation is consistent with the county's comprehensive plan.
Within the UDA in Swaza, in this case, the Swaza, the comprehensive plan expects that the land is to
develop on public water and sewer.
Now, this property is located outside of the Swaza, but currently is served by its existing health system,
and a water line that runs along 277.
So while this is outside of the Southern water service area, it is appropriate, of course, to continue
the expansion of this existing business, not on public water and sewer.
Point out the excerpt, if you will, from the count is comprehensive plan, which shows the industrial land use designation.
It also includes several small connecting streets in the general vicinity.
The applicant has included recognition of one of the minor collector streets on their generalized development plan.
In addition to that profit, the applicant is also specifically expressed that it will only be used for a metal fabrication business,
again, consistent with the existing land use.
A third profit that the applicant has included deals with the access to writings Mill Lane in Route 277.
There was a comment from V.O.T. and county transportation address this too, which requires a turn lane warrant analysis with the future development of the site.
The applicant has profit to do this, and then the be comfortable, if you will, and required by V.O.T.
to implement any improvements that may be shown without warrant analysis.
As I mentioned, there's a 100-foot wide strip shown on the generalized development plan.
So in addition to those transportation components, the applicant has also profit a monetary contribution in the amount of $1,000 for fine rescue services
and any impacts associated with that.
Generalized development plan, which shows the reservation.
The Planning Commission, when they address this, their public hearing on December the 18th recommended approval of the rezoning request and following a public hearing this evening.
We're seeking, of course, a decision from the Board of Supervisors on the rezoning request.
Be happy to answer any questions the Board may have, and Mr. John Lewis is here representing the application.
Thank you, sir. Any questions? Mr. Dunn.
It's running. On page five, you made the comment about transportation.
We'll just ask you directly, has the transportation issue been mitigated for future use?
I mean, the turn lanes, you know, their second paragraph addresses some of this, but this was written a week or so ago.
So, you know, five years from now, six years from now, seven years, is this going to be addressed, or are we going to have a problem of transportation loss?
No, sir. And so, we'd be not requiring a site plan in the warrant analysis with any future development of this property.
They would be able to identify and require any improvements associated with that site plan.
And that improvement will come at the cost of the applicant, not the taxpayer?
That's correct, sir. And if we go back to the Planning Commission, a couple of adjacent property owners, were concerned perhaps that that might impact their property.
That the state would come on in and impact their property. That would not be the case.
Should any improvements be necessary? The developer, the applicant, would have to either implement them through negotiations and appropriate, if you will, agreement with those property owners, or they would not occur to you.
I mean, Jason, property owners were okay with this at this point in time, correct?
I know you can't speak. The public hearing of the Planning Commission may work comfortable, so we'll hopefully get through this public hearing.
To the best you're not. Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Other questions from Mr. Ruddy, anyone?
Mr. Chairman, provide some clarity. First to follow up on Supervisor Dunn's questions.
You had mentioned that the applicant is willing to take on the construction that VDOP might require in the future or is not committed to doing that.
They would be required to do so. Mr. Lewis had expressed that, indeed, they would do so.
And I'm sure he will confirm that again this evening.
Is that written in the current proffers or is that something that?
That was in the current proffers. The commitment is in the writing of the current proffer.
That's all I have for Mr. Ruddy, thank you.
Thank you, sir. Other questions, anyone?
Thank you, sir.
Thank you. Mr. Lewis, anything you'd like to add?
Welcome, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm John Lewis with Painter Lewis, and I really don't have much else to add.
Yeah.
Is that all right?
Yeah, you have to really get after it.
But I will try to answer any questions. As far as the turn lane.
And speaking with the with my client, they don't have any problems getting in and out of their sight at the moment.
And as far as I know, there are any traffic problems out there.
So what we've proffered is to undertake a traffic study at the next sight plan to determine if a turn lane is warranted.
And we will do that under the guise of V dot.
And if it is warranted, V dot is not going to give us approval of a sight plan unless we make the improvements.
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
Two other questions for you.
As far as you know, the plans of the applicant with regard to the existing building and future development on the site.
Do they have any plans to expand the building, raise the building, and build a new building?
No plans to expand the building. They're planning to expand their lay down yard.
Okay.
And then the last question I have is with regard to the $1,000 proffer towards the fire and rescue department.
You know, typically we see proffer something in the range of, you know, 10 cents per square foot of the building on the property.
Can you explain how your client came to the conclusion of the $1,000?
So we're not building a building. We can't use that particular formula.
So we just grabbed the number.
Okay. Thank you.
Other questions, Mr. Lewis? Anyone?
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
So is the public hearing? Would anyone like to comment about this proposed rezoning?
If you'd come forward, share your name and Magisterial District and try to limit your comments to three minutes or less, please, sir.
Okay. Thank you.
My name is Gary Pearson. That's Gary with two ours.
Stonewall District, a member of the Liberty Baptist Church, which shares the corner property with Berlin Steel.
And the question that I have been asked to ask has been a little bit of clarification on the turn lane as well as the widening.
I believe it is a hundred feet of writings lane itself.
And there's also a question of the pictures that were showing up on the screen.
There's a series of pantries that goes along the church building, which we have always been under the impression of and understanding of that that was the property line.
The picture shows those pantries on the inside of the area to be, which includes all of writings property.
So we were just kind of looking for some clarification on, you know, do we have to anticipate the turn lane issue?
Do we have, you know, how does the one hundred foot impact us as far as widening writings lane?
And where do those pantries truly set?
So if I could get some clarification from anybody on that, he'll try.
We'll allow for Mr. Lewis an opportunity to speak to that.
And the pictures you see are not survey quality.
Okay. That could be why the pantries are where they are.
Okay. Well, thank you very much. I'll sit back down.
Sir?
Welcome.
To the board. My name is Phil Schiflett.
I'm with the Peckin District.
We got paperwork on this.
I represent the Liberty Baptist Church and the property that is together with the writings.
And we got the paperwork and one of our colleagues kind of went by the wayside and left us.
And so this is all brand new to us again.
We didn't know about this until last week.
I keep hearing, but I haven't seen it because it flies just so fast about the left turn lane.
And I reckon the question would be to those that's representing the steel place is when we say the left turn lane,
what impact is that going to have on 277 for Liberty Baptist Church?
Is that going to deter us from our entrance because we have a separate single entrance.
And then on up is their entrance probably within 35 feet of the property line.
And my question is we say turn left turn lane is where is that left turn lane?
Is that going to be coming east from Steven Zitty allowing them to have that out a middle lane for making a turn lane?
Where is that going to be coming from double toll gate from the west?
Because if it does then that would impact our property.
And we want to see if it impacts our property or not.
That's the question I have.
So again, we'll all for Mr. Lewis an opportunity to address your comments.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Is there anyone else who would like to comment about this proposed rezoning?
Anyone?
Anyone at all?
Seeing no one will close the public hearing portion.
Mr. Lewis, would you like an opportunity to address the comments you've received?
For the first 100 foot widening there is no plan for widening riding lane.
It's extremely wide at the intersection now.
So I could put that to bed.
There's not going to be any widening of riding slain itself.
Where the pine trees are, I don't know.
It might be on the property or they might not be.
But if there are no plans and probably there are not going to be any requirements to widen riding slain.
Therefore, the pine trees will not be disturbed.
The turn lane that may be warranted will be coming from the east from double toe gate.
And the reason we're talking about the turn lane is the latest traffic study that V. has done signs a certain number of daily trips.
And you go through their formulas and it appears that 277 from double toe gate all the way to Shrando should have a center turn lane.
So if the warrants show that we need a left turn lane, it will be coming from double toe gate.
It will pass in front of the Baptist church.
If it does go in, there will be allowance to let the Baptist church use the same turn lane as a Berlin steel.
I think I've answered all the questions.
Thank you, sir. Any questions of board members?
I heard you correctly, sir.
If you had that left hand turn lane, if you had that left hand turn lane, it would go past the church.
So the traffic that it was going to the church would essentially become the tail of the traffic that would be going into your property or your applicant's property.
I believe the church entrance is fairly close to riding line.
So any turn lane that is built, any left turn lane, again, a left turn lane going westbound would be utilized by the church also.
So the gentleman before he said 35 feet or so.
Are you living having traffic on Saturdays and Sundays? I'm assuming not.
No, no.
Turn lane is going to be probably 100 feet of taper and 100 feet of stacking.
Okay, thank you.
Sir, for us as well.
I'm very familiar with that intersection there.
To answer your question, it's not going to affect the turn end to the church.
It's going to have a third lane that they can use to come in.
It's not going to encourage on their existing entrance into the church.
It's the way I see that. I'm worried, John.
That's correct.
The entrance to the church stays the same.
The entrance remains as a turn lane in the road.
So they'll be able to use that turn lane also.
It's not going to affect their existing entrance.
I don't just concern that there's so much traffic that you know the area better than I do.
I don't foresee that as a problem.
Thank you, sir.
Yeah, because this is Opecum.
Yes, sir?
Mr. Chairman, I would move that we accept the rezoning request for number 03-19 for Burlelin steel
and dentist writings, estimated.
I've heard the motion is there a second.
Second.
And a second.
Is there any discussion?
One?
Roosevelt, great.
Hi.
Supervisor Dine?
Hi.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye.
He's called.
Viser Slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Aye.
Supervisor Fisher.
Aye.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
And the rezoning is approved.
Yes, sir.
It will bring us to rezoning 0519.
Martinsburg Pike LLC.
Thank you, Mr. Bishop.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.
As you noted, we do have a public hearing this evening.
We have 1.9 for Martinsburg Pike LLC.
This is an application to rezone 1.724 acres from the R.A.
Rule of Cultural District to the B2 General Business District with
Prophers.
The site is made up of three properties.
One of those contains a currently non-conforming structure that was once
operated as a store, but has been closed for more than two years.
There is a vacant parcel and there is also a parcel that contains a single-family
dwelling.
Currently between those lots, there are two entrances on to Route 11 North.
These subject properties are located at 2674 and 2682.
Martinsburg Pike, about 1,000-foot south of Stevenson Road.
The site is located within the limits of your Northeast Frederick Land Use Plan and
provides the properties with a mixed-used zoning designation for industrial and
office land uses.
The owner does intend to operate a restaurant in the existing commercial structure and
the site was previously, as I noted before, utilized as a country general store.
In general, the proposed zoning is inconsistent, restaurant versus office
industrial, with your 2035 comprehensive plan.
However, given the close proximity of residential property, it may still be acceptable as a
use proposed.
On the screen, you do see your long-range land use plan.
As I noted, those parcels are planned for office and industrial and you can see there's
residential across the street.
As far as Prophers, this applicant has proffered that the interior lot lines are going to be
vacated, so this will go from three to one lot.
The driveway connections will be consolidated, so there will only be one consolidated entrance.
The owner will up front be dedicating six-and-a-half-foot right away dedication for future
11 widening.
However, following that six-and-a-half, there's a further reserved 12-foot for future road
improvements and to just expound on that a little more.
Basically, acknowledging the fact that your comprehensive plan calls for that roadway to
eventually be six lanes divided and kind of point kind of accurately acknowledges the fact
that it's a lot more likely to become four lanes before it can become six lanes.
And as we worked with the applicant, it was fairly clear that without if they were to
try and proper the right away for all six lanes up front, the existing structures become fairly
useless, so it was done in this hybrid fashion.
In addition, the owners of this property will donate or cause to be donated for a county $310
and $0.40 are basically $0.10 per square foot of the structure for fire and rescue services.
And on screen to your left, you see a general description of what's going to take place
out there.
You see the right way that's been set aside as well as reserved.
And of course, the consolidated entrance, which is located roughly halfway between the
opposing entrances across the street.
There wasn't really one that you could align with, so that was the best thing that could be worked out
with staff and V.
Playing commission did review this item on December 18th and has recommended approval.
As noted, this is a public hearing.
Mr. Lewis is here representing the applicant.
Mr. Lanzada, who is also here, and I can take any questions you may have.
Thank you, sir.
Questions of Mr. Bishop?
Anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. President MacArthur.
Thank you, Mr. Bishop.
At the Planning Commission meeting, Commissioner Morrison asked the question as to whether or not
a turn lane would be necessary.
And I think you would respond to the not for this particular use.
Is there any use within that zoning which would maybe require this, that my concern is with
regard to making sure we have enough right-of-way set aside there in order to take in further future
uses under this zoning?
The right.
The right.
First party, a question.
Yes, there are uses that would generate more traffic and could likely trigger a turn lane.
However, based on this square footage, I'd have to look at that in the IT, a little more to find one.
However, the initial six and a half foot actually allows up to a four lane divided, which that divided
section includes a center turn lane.
So, there's fairly ample right-of-way to keep us going for a good while, frankly.
Thank you.
Other questions?
Mr. Bishop, anyone?
Anyone?
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Again, Mr. Chairman, I don't have anything to add except I want to say I think this is a terrific
reuse of the oats grocery store when we're talking about a pizzeria here.
So, I would really look forward to approval by you all tonight.
There's any questions?
I'll try to answer them.
Any questions of Mr. Lewis?
Anyone?
Seeing none?
Thank you very much, sir.
It's a public hearing.
Would anyone like to comment concerning this proposed rezoning?
Anyone?
Anyone?
Last call?
And we'll close the public hearing portion of the meeting.
This is Stonewall.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman, I will make a motion to approve rezoning application number 05-19, Martinsburg-Pike-LLC.
Second.
And the second.
Is there any discussion?
Anyone?
Viser Fishy.

Good evening, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the Board of Supervisors.
This is an application to rezone approximately 1.204 acres from the B2 general business district to the B3 industrial transition district with profits.
The site was previously utilized as a restaurant, Texas Steakhouse, which is now closed.
And the intended use for this site is a discount tire.
The subject property is located at 1.20 front rail pike.
Directing your attention to the screen, the subject property is outlined in blue.
Again, it's at the intersection.
Front rail pike and Millwood pike on that corner.
Home in front of the travel lodge.
The site is located within the limits of the Cincinnati Eastern Urban Area Plan of the 2035 Comprehensive Plan.
And this property is identified with a commercial land use designation.
In general, the existing B2 zoning and the proposed B3 zoning are consistent with the current land use supported by the Comprehensive Plan.
However, the plan states that this area should be designated specifically to accommodate and promote highway commercial land uses.
With this request, the applicant has profored out a number of land uses that would be restricted on the site.
That list is provided on the screen and was also provided in your staff report.
And the owners have profored that the development of the property will be in substantial conformity with a preliminary landscape plan, which was included as exhibit one of the profits included in your package.
And this land use preliminary land use plan is intended to fulfill a recommendation in the comprehensive plan for enhanced landscaping along this corridor.
And the applicant is fulfilling that requirement through that preliminary landscape plan.
And the owner is also offering a monetary contribution of 10 cents per developed building square footage for county fire and rescue services that equals out to about $812.90.
Again, directing your attention to the screen, this is the exhibit mentioned in the profits, which includes the enhanced landscaping along the frontage of Millwood Pike and Front Royal Pike to create an attractive frontage at that corner.
The planning commission recommended approval of this rezoning at their December 18th regular meeting and following the public hearing of the 17 staff is seeking a decision from the board of supervisors on this rezoning request.
Mr. Lawson is here this evening representing the applicants, and I believe he has a few slides to present as well, but I'm happy to answer any questions. Thank you.
Questions of Mr. Klein, anyone?
Supervisor Fish? Mr. Klein, I guess when I look at this, I wish we could proper in uses rather than proffering out.
But with the uses that have been proffered out, do you feel like in your opinion that the worst case scenario, I guess, as far as B3, as far as related to these, is there anything else that you would think of that's going to have a
impact would not be compatible with the B2 surrounding properties?
As most of you are aware, the B2 uses are also allowed in the B3, and then the B3 includes some of those transitional uses that are similar to industrial.
What the applicant has chosen to proper out are some of the most intensive uses as far as the intensity on site and also the traffic intensity.
But I can let Mr. Lawson also speak to those specific uses that have been proffered out.
Okay. Other questions of Mr. Klein, anyone?
Mr. Klein, as well.
This business comes in, we've proffered out all these things, and five years later, this business leaves. And those proffers?
They would stay in place?
They stay in place with the property.
Yes, or that would be correct.
So if someone came in and wanted to do one of the uses that was restricted, they would have to come back through the rezoning process to amend the approved proffers to allow such uses.
Okay.
Other questions of Mr. Klein, anyone? Supervisor Dunn?
But there are other B, Mr. Klein, but there are other B3 options, not listed here, but also would generate significant noise, or either truck traffic, et cetera.
Is that correct?
There are a number of B3 uses that were not restricted, that are not included in the proffers that could otherwise be allowed.
Many of them are similar to the uses that are already allowed in the B2, but there are some uses that have a higher intensity than the B2 zoning district that are allowed in the B3 that are not currently restricted.
Yes, sir.
I have a question.
If this is approved, when traffic going in here, what type of anticipated traffic is there for tires coming in, tires coming out?
I mean, I'm familiar with that intersection well and say congested area now, so was there any discussion on traffic?
Mr. Lawson, we'll touch on the traffic as part of his remarks, but what I can tell you, based on the traffic analysis that was included in the rezoning application, the use will generate less traffic than the proposed restaurant use that was previously there.
Less trips, but a different type of traffic.
Less trips overall.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you. Any other questions of Mr. Klein, anyone?
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Lawson, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Board of Supervisors, Title Lawson, here on behalf of Discount Tire.
It's a rezoning that intentionally follows and mirrors the valveline store rezoning that you all approved some time ago.
Same development.
It's on the other side of the IHOP.
We do hear your comments about the uses and what I want to do tonight is speak about those and then actually we've got a few more we think we can exclude so we can be more restrictive.
But what I'd like to do first, I have two folks that I'd like to have speak.
One is Mark Walters from Discount Tire to acquaint you all with the operation.
And I think you'll be impressed.
And then the other is we have two engineers here, Cutter, Sydney and Jordan Brooks from Kenley Horn to talk about the layout.
And frankly, the enhancement that's going to happen to that corner if this is approved.
First, I'll turn it over to Mark and then I think you'll hear from Cutter.
And then I would like to come up and speak to the uses and I don't want to tease anything, but we are going to take out some of those other uses as well.
And then of course, we'd love to hear from whoever has a comment and then have the opportunity to respond.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
Good evening, commissioners.
Thanks for the opportunity to speak to you on behalf of Discount Tire.
Discount Tire started in 1960 with one store in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Over the last 60 years, the company has grown to over 1,050 stores and 35 states.
Because I was sitting in my chair there listening to the story before about a small business and the zoning needing to be changed.
It reminded me when I started working for Discount Tire in 1984.
It was in a very small town and I'm sure that the same process had to be gone through.
And fortunately for me and for many like me that the decision was made to rezone.
Because we were able to open that store in that small town and 35 years later.
Because we are a company that strictly deals in tires and wheels and promotes from within.
I have put hell just about every position in our company and store operations that's available from a service tech to an assistant manager to a store manager to a system vice president regional vice president today in the real estate department.
Discount Tire has got an incredibly people centered culture.
Our people and our customers are the most important thing to us.
Our commitment is the safety and happiness of those that we work with and those that we work for.
We're closed on Sundays to allow our people the opportunity to worship to spend the time with their family that they've worked so hard to be able to do.
And I can tell you that Discount Tire has taken me to places and taken care of me over the last 35 years unlike any company I can imagine.
I'm certainly happy to answer any questions that you may have regarding Discount Tire.
You'll see the building and you'll see some of the things going forward.
But if you've got any questions regarding Discount Tire, I'm happy to answer them.
Any questions? Anyone? Mr. Chairman?
How are the tires delivered and then take it off the property?
I want to set my truck as a box truck. What is the typical?
It would depend on the volume of the store in the beginning. It would probably be a pop truck box truck.
As the store grows in volume, it would be a semi.
But those are intermittent weekly deliveries, not certainly not daily.
Are there displays outside of the store with tires on display, sort of like a promotion or are all the tires kept within the four walls of the facility?
How is that typically handled?
All inventory of the stores kept inside the building.
Staying consistent with city ordinances and restrictions, displays outside would fall into that category.
But all of the inventory is kept inside the building.
So there's potential for sort of advertisements or sort of emotion of...
If allowed. Thank you.
Yeah.
Are there questions anyone? Supervisor Dodd?
In the summertime, what type of noise does your facility generate?
What kind of noise, sir?
Minimal noise because everything is enclosed inside the building.
So really, the only noise would be impact wrenches that, again, outside the building, you really can't hear them.
And traffic going in and out.
You've made the comment to Mr. McCarthy once a week.
Inventory would come in and out.
It would be delivered and unloaded, yes.
No noise would be generated from that off the truck and into the building.
And then how much is exported?
When you say exported, sir, what do you mean?
You have stuff coming in.
Items going out.
Is that generate or is that just simply sold and gone?
How much traffic is being generated by people that are buying the product and leaving, I guess, as well as asking a question?
I can't answer that completely.
I would think Mr. Lawson would be able to.
Thank you.
Yes.
Other questions, anyone?
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Good evening, supervisors.
As Ty said, my name is Cutter Sidner.
I'm a licensed civil engineer in Virginia and have worked with discount tire for several years across the state with them and on their stores.
As Ty said, I want to touch quickly on the site plan, so I'm going to pull that up on the screen as a reference and talk to two or three aspects of that.
The building orientation has been kept as close to the interior lot lines as possible.
You'll see the large chamfered corner and green space.
That's actually part of VDOT's right of way at the intersection.
So that is off limits to us and will remain property of VDOT.
And to elaborate a little on Mark's points, we have designed the truck with, or excuse me, we have designed the site with adequate circulation for truck deliveries.
There is discussion in our application packet of the comparison of the restaurant use to the tire store use as far as trips generated.
It is a pretty drastic decrease because of the amount of traffic coming in and out at peak dining hours for the restaurant.
As Tyler mentioned, there is a recommendation for enhanced landscaping along this corridor and the comprehensive plan.
You'll see a mix of shade trees, ornamental trees, and then evergreens and shrubs to screen the parking and building and kind of create that enhanced buffer along both street frontages.
And this leaves, we've left about 45 to 50 feet along front royal pike.
And anywhere from 15 to 20 feet along Millwood Pike, all that will be planted as you can see in the green on this plan.
Our goal there has been to provide that enhanced landscaping to Tyler's point and that is an increase from the parking that you see today when you drive past that intersection.
And so the overgrown shrubs and curb line that you see there will be pulled back significantly and new plantings per this plan would be installed.
Lastly, I'll touch a little bit on stormwater management. This development does have an overall drainage pond that this site drains into.
Regulations have become more stringent in the past, which would apply to this site. We will comply with all current regulations and part of our goal and strategy to do that is this increase in green space.
These buffers provide not only an enhanced visual buffer to the site, but they also give us about 20% more green space through the islands, through the green areas that you see on here that we're just not part of the old layout with the older restaurant and parking areas for that.
So I'm going to turn it back over to Ty, but like Mark, I'm happy to answer any questions specific to the site and landscaping plan here now or at the end of the presentation.
So I notice in the application it refers to the landscaping plan is the preliminary landscaping plan. Is there a secondary landscaping plan in the works or are you planning on using that as the landscaping plan?
This is the landscaping plan to paraphrase. We call it that just because we have not broken out in construction detail, but that will be part of our site plan process that will come before the county staff after the rezoning process.
Thank you.
Any questions? Anyone? Thank you, sir. Thank you all.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You all have read your staff report and the comments that we received came from one neighbor who I believe was speaking for himself and another, and it had to do with the uses.
As a result of that, we have gone through the uses that we have excluded, and again, we intentionally excluded the same uses that were excluded when you all approved the Valveline store.
But we went through it, and if you will, scrubbed it, and I'm going to hand this out so nobody has to sit in the memory test. But anyway, we're going to delete some other uses as well.
One is the second item on the list. It's offices and storage facilities for building construction contractors, heavy construction contractors, and special trade contractors.
Mr. Fisher asked about, as the worst case, been profit out. We saw that and thought that that may deliver some heavy equipment and things like that, so we deleted those.
Also, building, these are deleted in addition to the list. Building materials, hardware, garden supply, mobile home dealers, retail, nurseries, wholesale trade businesses, also being deleted.
We're not sure we know what this means, but we're going to delete it. Miscellaneous repair services. We've been assured that that does not unintentionally delete what we do.
Tyler was kind enough to share that with me. But subject to that confirmation, we would be able to proper that out. Self-service storage facilities, propering that out as well. Accessory retailing, again, assuming that that does not unintentionally deprive us of the ability to sell lug nuts or those sensor things that are in your tires and tell you when you got low pressure and things like that.
Tyler shared with me, he didn't think that that would be it. That's if you've got an ice cream store or something that's affiliated with what you're doing, we're not doing that. Public utility distribution facilities, we would also remove those.
Accidential uses, which are accessory to allowed business uses, again, delete those. Flex tech would also be deleted. And I've got a red line and a clean of this that I'll be happy to deliver to the clerk, that those would be deleted uses in addition to the others.
It was a great comment. I believe Tyler made about the B2 uses that are already allowed by right. And I believe we counted, there's actually 28 uses that are found in both. And the B2 and the B3. So making the switch from a B2 to a B3 is not that dramatic.
It was necessary as it was in the valveline rezoning to allow for that automotive component. And that's why, and that's why we've done the rezoning.
Briefly to questions, the proffers do run with the land, they would be binding on the property unless and until this board or some subsequent board would amend them. So all these restrictions would remain.
And with regard to the traffic, I found it interesting, it's not only that we would have far less trips than what was at Texas State House or what would have been for the general harvest. Remember, they own, they own the property currently, and they were looking at it for the possibility of a store.
But also, there was a mention of the planning commission about trucks. We have a delivery once a week and the use tires, by the way, what an ass. But at the planning commission, I found it interesting. They store those inside.
There's no outside storage of the use tires, which I found very interesting.
But I'm confident, and I remember the deliveries at the restaurant by truck. And I'm thinking they were more than a week. So it's not only a less, lesser number of customer cars coming in to get tires.
But also, you're going to have a lesser number of trucks to the site, because as Mark pointed out, we're once a week, whereas with a restaurant, you're feeding it several times throughout the week.
And depending on what delivery company you're using, it's a delivery, it's a box truck or a tractor trailer. So we don't have any of those either.
I'd be happy to respond to any questions, but I'll deliver to the clerk the uses that were striking out, not only the ones that you already had, but then also the additional ones. And I thank you.
Thank you, sir.
This is a public hearing. Is there anyone who would like to speak concerning this proposed application? If you would, sir, if we could have your name, Magisterial District, attempt to limit your comments to three minister, less, please.
Good evening. My name is Brooke Middleton. I'm here on behalf of General Harvest, the current owner. I just wanted to give a little background.
We purchased the De Havens property in Pregnant County, and we continued to operate that slaughterhouse, and we bought this property with the intention of using it as a restaurant.
If it was used by someone else or us as a restaurant, it would have multiple deliveries every day at our other locations. We have multiple deliveries every day.
But for various reasons, it just didn't work out for us, so we listed it for sale. We've had a number of people contact us, including hotel developers, but we looked at these folks in discount tire, and I've actually visited several of their stores.
They're a quality operation and they're an asset to the community. They are good jobs, so I respectfully ask that you approve this. It's a blighted building, and I think it's important for the community of which we're part of to get someone in there. Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir. Anyone else like to comment concerning this proposed rezoning? Yes, sir.
Good evening. My name is Rahan. We're the owners of the 160 front row bike, the travel lodge right behind the Akin's building, and behind the proposed discount tire.
We'd like to address two or three concerns that I would have for this proposed plan. One being the pneumatic drill noises in the equipment or the material that would be stored, or the noises that would occur, at least for our hotel guests.
During normal hours, we have guests that do come in who do stay multiple nights, who would want to stay for later checkout times as well.
During those times, if these noises are a major issue, we do have plenty of returning guests, near the 18% of our entire revenue is for returning guests, and I wouldn't be surprised if that amount does decrease because of the noises that would cause from this.
I'm not so sure based on what I heard is that the noises would be minimum, it would be contained now if in the summertime, if the bays are open, if the installation or any of that is occurring, I'm sure at that time the noises would hinder especially for our guests.
And that major, I mean, that part is pretty bit concerned in the other part. The tax parcel is 64a1, which is the lane that goes from front row to bike, entering 120 discount tire and 160 for us, that lane is, we own that, we pay tax on that, we maintain that lane itself.
The amount of use, the amount of possibility of damage to that lane, the heavy truck usage entering into that lane, we maintain the landscaping, we maintain the roads on that for on a yearly basis, we stripe it, we paint it, all of those things.
So for that, you know, who's to say later on what happens to that if this zoning is changed, you know, we're not aware what could happen even afterwards.
And these trucks, I'm not sure, you know, like they have mentioned, preliminary, it might just be box truck, they might have space to turn around, but if it's semi truck, we highly doubt that there is space for them to go in and turn it around.
Speaking from Texas take house, when we have owned that, we've owned this property for 12, for more than 12 years, we're familiar with the Texas take house deliveries, US food service and other companies that have come and delivered, they have had to enter into our parking lot to go ahead and do deliveries and then turn around, because of the way that the building is situated.
You know, I'm not surprised if if that same would occur where they do have to enter into our specific parking lot to go ahead and either delivery or to do, I mean, it just enables them to do that, to enter the parking lot.
And we can't speak on behalf of the delivery guys of the trucks that are delivering of any of them, whether if they can come in and, you know, there's no restriction on that.
So, I think those two is one of our biggest concerns for this proposed plan.
Thank you.
Is there anyone else who would like to speak concerning this proposed rezoning?
Thanks, sir.
Good evening. My name is Steve Parish. I'm with the Back Creek District.
I personally own a warehouse and Stonewall Industrial Park.
I own some retail spaces here in the county. I'm partnered with some hotels and some apartments.
I am not anti-development. I am pro business.
My issue with this project is we're changing something from a B2 use to a B3 use.
And I do believe that B3 definitely has a place.
We had the opportunity because we owned the Fairfield in down the road when the valveline was redone.
We did not oppose that. It did not affect us. There was no, not pneumatic drills in there.
It was, you know, it was quiet, you know, it was a quiet space.
And that's how we felt about it. You know, we, we own the acres.
I'm part of the Acens group.
And we own the Acens office building there with a residential penthouse on the top.
So I've got residential and I've got, I've got businesses in there that is going to be affected.
I like the landscaping on the front. If you notice, there's no landscaping or screening between our building located there on the left.
And the garage bays.
And I tell you, I have been just like you guys have around garages, whether it's the jiffy Louvre or the valveline,
or right in front of the Lowe's here in town, and they throw the, and it's a tire place.
They throw those garage bays up. It's 60 degrees outside as guys are working hard.
The pneumatic drills, you guys have all heard them. You go to Stutzman's or anybody, it's not Stutzman anymore, sorry.
You go to any of those places that you use the nose. It's loud.
We've got tenants there that it's concerned and let us know that they're concerned about the rezoning.
And I'm not anti-business at all. I'm just anti-business when somebody comes in and changes something that's going to affect my business.
And I'm afraid this will hurt my property value. You know, it's a discount tire place.
Interstate 81 is right there. We've got 522. We've got Route 50. It's one of the main corridors into our county, into our city.
And we're putting something there. I don't like a building that's been sitting there empty for four years.
Just like no one else here. We want tax revenue. I know that eventually it will be sold. I know eventually that a B2 will come in there.
And I know eventually it'll, they'll make that property work.
And so I'm willing to wait on a better use for that piece of property knowing that I have this building over here that our business is trying to run.
And we just want to have peaceful enjoyment. I do appreciate the fact that they've come back and they've said, hey, we're going to profit some of this stuff out.
There are still a few things that would be nice to have profit out. But one of the worst things on the list is exactly what they do.
Make noise. And I really appreciate that it's a business been around since the 50s or 60s. I forget what it was. Our business has been around.
It's a fairly young company. We've been around since 1931. And we've seen a lot. And we're continuing to develop. And we're going to come back before you guys.
And we're going to ask for rezoning and that kind of stuff. And we want to be around another 80, 90 years.
And I just hope that you guys will be receptive. But what I don't want to do is come up here, try to change something that's going to affect my neighbor.
And what I'm saying is we feel that that building in that spot not only affects our business and certainly Rohan's business, but it also affects the community, Frederick County.
It is not the use that we should have coming into our main corridor. And I really appreciate you guys for listening. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Anyone else like to comment?
Good evening, Jason Acons, owner of the Acons office building, just so left.
I'm not going to reiterate everything that my business partner already mentioned in regards to the noise. I think it's it's very plain and evident that many garages in town do throw up doors in the middle of the afternoon.
We've got a lot of tenants in there right now. We're about 90% occupied. And if you look at that graph, I haven't seen the exact drawings of the building.
But I would assume where it's hash marked on the left hand side would be the bays for the cars would go in. And all that sounds going to be flooded back to the left hand side.
So I'll leave that alone. But my my family built that office building in the mid 1980s. About 35 years ago. And my grandfather actually built the restaurant that's currently on the site.
We built that restaurant to compliment the actual overall development. Now, obviously we sold that restaurant years ago. Many other restaurants have been in there and been successful.
And in the future, other other items are going to go there other than restaurants. But I think what we're trying to do here is trying to simply rezone a piece of land to try to get something sold.
B2 is probably one of the most beef business friendly zonings that's out there. And what we're doing is taking B3. We might as well say we're just trying to set precedence and add discount tires in to B2.
Because we're striking out so many different things from B3 to really just create it so that we can fit get this thing sold.
I don't think that's doing our community in the future any do justice personally. And what as Steve mentioned what it's going to do to my property value.
And in the future and make it my future market ability for professional tenants. If I've got an office and I'm trying that's vacant, which I do right now, about 3000 square feet.
I'm going to have a lot harder time getting that rented. If I've got someone that's coming up that I'm trying to show the spot. And I've got dramatic drills being shot off on the on the right hand side of the building.
Or it and it is what it is. The I'm not against discount towers. Tires to be honest with you. What I'm against is that what happens when discount tires decides to move out.
And what's going to be there next in our business or build and hold organization. I've had the building for 35 years. I'm hoping that I have it for another 35 years.
And that I'm concerned about what's going to happen next as soon as we open the floodgates into another zoning. So appreciate your consideration and declining the rezoning. Thank you.
Thank you. Anyone else like to comment. Anyone at all.
We'll close the public comment portion of the meeting. Mr. Lawson.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Greatly appreciate the comments. Some of which we've heard before.
Mr. Middleton talking about the prospect cities had.
And a challenge of getting it sold. We we've all we remember Texas stay cast and it somebody said four years. I didn't realize it had been that long, frankly, but it's been a while in that current status.
With regard to Mr. Shaw and talking about drill noises and causing problems. Actually, the the way this thing is is situated.
The doors would be pointing out towards front royal pike. What would be up against the travel lodge is is a mason rebuilding in the back and on the sides.
So I think that addresses that plus the work is is done inside.
I think Mr. Shaw also talked about the road and concerned about who owned it.
And I will tell you and Mr. Williams will attest we spent a lot of time looking at that road trying to figure out who owned it and how it came about.
The roads actually that go into this development. When when Mr. Acans did this project a long time ago, we're supposed to be dedicated.
We're supposed to be public roads. And and they actually recorded a dedication to evolve parties, the county.
I don't think you all ever accepted him. I know V dot didn't either. But those roads have been and there was a one year maintenance agreement back in the 80s that Mr. Acans had.
With all the property owners, but the short answer is all the property owners have maintained those roads ever since.
And they're they're in an odd position because they've been dedicated to the county.
And it's not a county obligation to take care of them. But certainly this property owner will take care of them as as the others have over the year.
With regard to the turnaround and I'll be happy to tender this, the engineers actually did a template to show that and this is actually for a large tractor trailer.
I believe the testimony was that it was primarily box trucks, but shows how and they actually design this to make sure that a tractor trailer can get in on site.
Don't go on anybody else's property back up and then leave the property and and so they figured it out and they're able to demonstrate that everything stays on property.
Mr. Middleton gave us some information about the deliveries to their stores and to restaurants. And I believe what he said is trucks multiple deliveries each and every day.
We're once a week. So much less.
I found an interesting Mr. Parrish. I appreciate his canter. He didn't object to valveline, which again is in the same development that way back when Mr. Mr. Akin senior developed.
I say that because valveline actually will rotate your tires just like a jiffy lub and so on. And that apparently was not objectionable.
They also do oils and other things. We do not. We just do tires. We don't do any of those fluids and other services that some tire stores do.
It's an important distinction to point out the trees on the side. There was a comment about that. That's that's all asphalt right now.
What we're proposing to do is to cut in some green. But for all these years, I appreciate the comments about concerns about what's going on before the Texas State House, the back end of the house actually face the office building.
And parking was wherever you wanted to be. And it bled over in daikens. It bled over into the travel lodge. Because of course, that was a busy, busy bar and restaurant in its day.
With this use, you won't have that. We'll be confined to our property. And of course, our trips will be much less. So we believe will actually be a much better neighbor than what was there before.
And certainly it's much enhanced with the landscaping. All of that we believe with the significant investment of this store actually increases the value of the property increases not only the value of this corner and this important corridor, but also the properties around it.
So for all these reasons, we thank you all for your time and would greatly appreciate a vote and support. And I'll deliver this also to the clerk.
Thank you, sir.
All right, this is Stonewall.
How about Sonny?
Sonny, I'm sorry.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman, I thought you were going to take me off the hook.
Now, Mr. Fisher, you're on the hook. Thank you, sir.
You know, when I first saw this, I had really a lot of concerns issues, but the more I looked into it, you know,
I'm going to go down several items and probably what I'm going to ask to do only because staff has not reviewed the paperwork is probably a postponement on the next meeting just so they can review the paperwork that Mr.
also just handed in. But, you know, on the noise, I went up there and sat on the lot. I've done it a couple times.
Those trucks coming down 522 with Jake Breaks.
They're far worse than any impact wrench. And I understand about impact branches, but the way the store is located with the doors to the front.
And actually, the noise coming off 81 being on the 522 side, even with the travel lodge in the way the noise from 81 is pretty significant.
So, I think the noise issues for me, it's a noisy, noisy corner to start with. Traffic issues, this impact, I think the staff has said, is a lot less than the restaurant.
The particular layout, I think, actually restricts truck traffic from going any place, but on their property.
And as they mentioned, the design so they can turn the trucks around, I think the impacts with deliveries is less with this particular application.
And as far as the B3 zoning, again, I think our ability to be flexible, I guess in a perfect world, I'd like to say, well, we'll just say this use is all you can use.
You know, that's quite an investment for somebody to make. And if it gets changed, they've got to come back and reduce some things or resume.
So, I think the opportunity for staff to review the paperwork that Mr. Lawson has given us needs to be done.
So, what I would like to do is make a motion to postpone any action on rezoning 0719 until the next meeting of, if that gives staff enough time to review to the next meeting in February.
All right, you've heard the motion. Is there a second?
And the second, is there any discussion? Anyone?

Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir.
Members of the Board of Supervisors, this is the 2025 Capitol Improvement Plan discussion item.
At the end of this evening's discussion, we're looking for direction from the Board of Supervisors to move this forward to public hearing.
The CIP has rolled familiar as a document that consists of major Capitol expenditures for the county, typically within the first five-year window.
It also includes a category that was added several years ago to recognize that there are projects that are six years and plus, so longer vision projects, if you will, are a component of the CIP.
Some caveats that go with the Capitol Improvement Plan every year, that the inclusion of projects on the CIP is no way an indication that the county will be undertaking these projects.
It's strictly an advisory document to aid in capital facilities planning and not for requesting funding allocations.
Once the CIP is in place, then priorities certainly may change throughout the year based on changing circumstances.
And it's very possible that projects would not be funded during the year identified in the CIP.
Again, it's a planning document.
And because it's a planning document, it seeks to ensure that there's a connection between the comprehensive plan for the county, the CIP and future rezoning applications.
I'll point out that there are 82 projects in this year's CIP, generally consistent with the number that we've had previously.
It covers projects from schools, parks and recreation, the regional library, county administration, fine rescue, transportation, Winchester Regional Airport.
And the CIP is broken down into three tables.
This one being projects or expenditures, if you will, that are general government expenditures.
The second one being transportation and the third being the airport, which of course get their funding from a very different set of sources.
I mentioned that there are 82 projects contained within this.
Let me add an additional one, if you will, an 83rd project.
This is an extension and coordination happened with the fine rescue department very recently to recognize that the Clearbrook expansion, new facility, if you will, was not included with their submission this year.
So we do indeed have that from the fine rescue department this afternoon.
And the intent would be to add that into the CIP to ensure that that's part of the public hearing process.
So I wanted to make that additional clarification if I could.
On the screen to your left, it just highlights of the CIP, of course, the cover.
It includes the table with all of the different projects identified, broken down by different entities.
Quite difficult to see on here, but I know it's very detailed and contained within your agenda.
And of course, also available online to anybody who may be interested.
Again, there's the table.
It's accompanied by four maps.
First map recognizes the general general location of the government facilities, if you will.
General government facilities.
The second one addresses schools and their CIP needs.
The third one being Parks and Recreation.
And the fourth map being the Tech County's Transportation CIP map.
The CIP was endorsed by the Comprehensive Plans and Programs Committee at their descent meeting,
and provided a recommendation that it was in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
The Planning Commission, when they recommended approval of their January 15th meeting,
again, recognized the CIP's being in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan,
to ensure that the public uses identified in the CIP met that review,
which is a 2232 review, again, seeking conformance with the Comprehensive Plan for these public facilities.
What we're looking for again this evening is approval, if you will, or endorsement to go ahead
and schedule the public hearing for the 2020 to 2025 CIP.
I'd be happy to answer any questions that the Board of Supervisors may have,
and to recognize that we have representatives over several of the departments responsible for putting this together here,
as this evening should you have questions of them.
Thank you, sir.
Questions of Mr. Roddy or the rest of staff? Anyone?
I just have one.
Supervisor Dutt.
I've been on the sport for four years, and we've had these CIPs.
Has there ever been a consideration to just rank in priorities?
I mean, I know you have lots of competing interests.
It's a tax payer to fund A, B, or C.
Has there ever been a discussion on that, for example?
The libraries have an interest in having a new library.
It's since an degree when that's about a mile from my home.
But where does that rank in comparison to some of the other items that are listed there as well?
And can I not go and drive three miles into town to go to Hanley just going a mile?
So is that type of trade-offs?
Have they ever thought about doing that?
The Aquatic Center, which we've talked about before.
So if you go through and just ask, what are the highest priorities from all of them?
I think a very fair question, but to recognize that each of these submissions from the different departments
come from those departments in conjunction with their boards, commissions, and committees.
So those folks, if you will, the Parks and Recreation Commission have identified their priorities
and then labeled them in such an order.
Many, many years ago, the projects were ranked by the planning commission through that process.
That was deemed to be quite inappropriate, perhaps, because they weren't the appropriate folks to do that.
And let's leave it to the airport authority.
Let's leave it to the school board, et cetera.
Not to say something can be done in the future, but given that responsibility to the responsible entities
is probably a very good approach, and that's what we tried to do today.
Thank you.
Other questions? Mr. Ruddy, anyone?
Thank you, sir.
Thanks.
The question is, is it ready to go to public hearing?
I would like to handle the request.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I move to Senate to public hearing.
Motion to send it to public hearing.
Second.
Second.
Any discussion?
All those in favor, aye.
Aye.
Opposed, no.
No.
No.
One.
We'll send it to public hearing.
All right.
Mr. Board, liaison reports?
Are there any?
Chairman?
Yes, sir.
So, the fire and rescue has done their chapter 89, which is pulling together all 11 companies to try to work together.
Theoretically, that will help the county, as the law starts to act, is not to say when the unit is all independent.
They're going to work together, so that's been a significant change for what's been there before.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
Any other liaison reports?
Anyone?
All right.
Citizen comments on any issue at all?
Is there anyone who would like to address the board?
Anyone?
Mr. Morse?
Yes, Alan Morse and Gainesburg District.
It's our favorite time of year.
Working on the budget.
Who gets what?
Coming mainly from a business background working for a large international company, I have conflicts with the way the government operates.
If I was a financial person, ranking Frederick County, I would put us on the verge of bankruptcy, because we have an extinguating debt.
We have an growing, rapidly growing demand for services, and we have a very fixed income base.
The only advantage government has is when they run out of money, they can tax the consumer, but something businesses can't do.
I'm very concerned that government only grows.
Some of us necessary because of an increased demand for services, but a lot of it is because somebody reads a magazine and finds out somebody else has something, and we want that too.
In business, when your income is limited, you find ways to conserve and improve processes and get more out of your money than what we do out of government.
And I'm just discouraged a little bit about how this has been going on for many years.
The other thing I would like to address today is Frederick County values.
We have people that have been here during their lives, and they have a life value that they live by, and they expect others to live by.
And we have people that come in from out areas, and they bring a decidedly different set of values.
I get disturbed when I see people trying to implement programs and efforts in Frederick County that run contrary to the basic dignities of human life that we are so used to in Frederick County.
So as you go through this rather difficult and intricate problem that you go through every year, try to keep some of these things in mind.
So do we have to spend more money? We have to spend what money we have more wisely. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Anyone else that would like to bring anything to the attention of the board? Anyone?
Seeing no one? We'll close the public comment. Portion Board of Supervisors comments. Are there any?
Seeing none? Vice Chairman Wells?
That's Tim, and I move via adjourn.
I should do a adjourn in a second?
Second.
All those in favor are.
I stand adjourned. We thank everyone for their time of attention and their comments.
