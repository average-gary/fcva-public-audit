I'll call the order of December 2nd, 2020, Federcai Planning Commission.
This time I asked everyone President to join me in a moment of silence, please.
Thank you.
First item on our agenda is the adoption of the agenda.
There's no changes or additions to that.
Where's Mr. Ruddy?
He's over there, and I don't believe there is.
I'll take a motion to adopt our agenda.
I got a motion in a second.
All those in favor?
Aye.
All right, agenda is adopted.
The next item is our meeting minutes.
And there are November 4th, 2020 meeting minutes.
And I believe where there's one change on those, Mr. Ruddy, before we approve.
The second to the motion was signed by the Planning Commission to do, or the Planning Commission
Roots.
Thank you.
And there's no other changes to those minutes.
As Mr. Ruddy has read to him, I'll accept a motion to approve the minutes with the change
that Mr. Ruddy has spelled out.
So moved.
Second.
All those in favor?
Aye.
The minutes from November 2nd, our, uh, November 4th, our, excuse me, brings us to committee
reports.
Uh, first one up for us is the DRC is Mr. Oates.
Uh, yes, or we met last Monday, um, and the only item we had to discuss is what's before
us tonight.
The, uh, FEMA changes to our floodplain ordinance.
I'll keep, thank you, sir, and I'll keep Mr. Oates on board with the Transportation Committee
report.
Uh, yes, we met, uh, November 23rd, the same day, um, the big item on the agenda was
the capital improvement program update over our road system, um, made just a couple small
changes, and that'll be coming through the CPPC soon.
Uh, we also had a, uh, instance where we finally had a road paved out the northern end
of the county, um, and for the first time, the, some people living on it, didn't
like it.
Oh, so, uh, just so everyone understands our secondary road paving program, when the
residents on the road request that the road be looked at, it studied the, uh, geometry
of its looked at, the safety, accidents, all that type of stuff goes into play.
And based on its ranking, it gets added to a list, and it may take 20 years before
finally gets to the top of where it gets its funding, but it doesn't come off the list
because a neighbor changes her mind because at that point, it's a public safety item,
and it's funded through V dot, and it's, they're barely with that.
Okay.
So keep that in mind as once you request your road, and it starts to do the system, it's,
it's in.
Good information to have.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, our next committee report is our Winchester planning.
Uh, liaison cannot be with us tonight, but Mr. Reddy is taking the spot of the Winchester
liaison, Mr. Reddy.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, this was submitted by Lacey Burnett on behalf of the Winchester City Planning Commission.
They met on November the 17th and, uh, recommended approval of five items, number one, be in
a conditional use permit for a single family detached dwelling at 2645 Valley Avenue.
Number two, an ordinance amending the zoning ordinance pertaining to by right and conditional
use permits for multifamily structures in the B one district, which is their central
business district.
They also recommended an ordinance repealing and replacing the, the city's zoning ordinance
pertaining to floodplains, which of course is something that we're dealing with tonight.
The fourth item was a resolution initiating an ordinance amending the zoning ordinance
with regards to lot density regulations in the B one central business district.
And finally, they recommend approval of an ordinance to rezone the 22.7 acres of land
at 441 Lyndon Drive from low density residential to low density residential with a plan unit
development overlay district.
Of course, that is the site of the old Frederick County middle school.
And that concludes the information that was provided on behalf of the city of Winchester.
Thank you, Mr. Reddy, for filling in.
Appreciate that.
With the next portion of our meetings, our citizen comments, anyone that would like to come
forward, speak to us about anything other than what's on our agenda tonight.
Now's the time to come forward.
You know, one even in the crowd, I'll close the citizen comments.
We'll move on.
So we'll bring up Miss Perkins for our information discussion item, which is our F here with
our floodplain district overlay amendments.
Miss Perkins.
For chairman members of the commission, it's my entrance music.
On January 29th, 2021, Frederick County will be getting put into an updated FEMA flood map.
So that's going to take effect in January.
So I would note that these floodmaps are the official community maps that showed the
special flood hazard areas and the risk premium zones.
Now flood mapping is an important part of the national flood insurance program as it
is the basis for the regulations for the flood insurance requirements.
Now FEMA does produce those maps and on those, they, with their risk mapping, it plans
and shows the risk areas.
And then FEMA is the one that maintains those maps and updates them.
So a lot of the basis behind the changes that are, before you tonight, is when we get
a new, when we get new flood maps from FEMA, we are required to update our ordinances.
And that's really, we receive model ordinances that show the changes that we have to implement
from DCR.
So this is similar to the past two changes, 2014 and 2012, that when we got new maps.
So kind of following along with the floodmaps and the updates and the flood insurance,
flood insurance is only available to property owners in Virginia through the National
Flood Insurance Program, which is administered through FEMA.
Now Frederick County is a participant in that flood program to get insurance.
So therefore, we have to keep an updated ordinance that is compliant with the regulations
as mandated by DCR and FEMA.
So I'm just kind of, kind of tap through some of the changes that you're going to, that
are outlined in the ordinance.
There's some changes to, just really the text, a lot of it's, there's some reorganization,
there's some new text, there's some updated definitions, there's some new sections for
the map revisions, it's a new section on boundary changes for jurisdictions.
One of the bigger sections that has changed is an addition for accessory structures,
whereas before there wasn't any mention of the accessory structures, there's some revisions
to the standards for manufacturer homes and recreational vehicles, as well as existing
structures and floodplains.
And then, so that's kind of really just a run through of the main changes, a lot of
the other stuff is just rearranging, rewarding some of the existing stuff.
I would note that the majority of the changes that are shown in your ordinance are mandated,
they're required by DCR, so it's not something that we had a lot of leeway in changing.
If you read through the model ordinance, there are some particular pieces that are pointed
out, which DCR shows as increases above the minimum standards that they do recommend.
And through the development review and regulations committee, when they met last week, there
was really only one piece of that that really felt necessary to be kind of continued in
the discussion, and that is, it's in your, the draft ordinance before you in red, and
it's also on the screen in red, it's a change to the existing structure and floodplain
areas.
It's really stating what DCR recommends is that you should include a text that states
a change when added to all the changes made during a rolling five-year period, it does
not constitute 50% of the structure value.
So DCR is requesting that that be considered for an additional increase, just to ensure
that you're not really trying to bypass it by doing incremental changes.
So, Mr. Oates stated the DRC to discuss this, their meeting last, last week, and then
they did recommend approval of the changes with the inclusion of that one piece that I
just discussed.
So, with that, I'd be glad to ask any questions.
We are seeking your comments to forward to the Board of Supervisors, as well as a recommendation
on the additional standard from DCR.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ms. Perkins.
It's an information and discussion.
Mr. Oates, I thought that the meeting we decided not to do that rolling five years.
That's the one that the committee did keep in.
We took out the additional free board pieces and the portion in the definitions.
Okay.
So, the reason I thought we decided not to go along with that five-year rolling deal.
I can't remember, I'll tell you the truth.
When I read it there, I'm kind of like Mr. Oates, but when I read it there, I don't remember
us doing that endorsing that one.
That's what I was like, I'm reading that then again, and that's what's gotten me just
a little bit there.
That's what's down side of that.
Well, one of the structures value, not size, so if you're putting in a really, really
nice kitchen or an addition that increases the value of the structure by 50%, even though
it may not increase the size very much, you're called on that.
That's one thing.
Isn't that kind of the whole point?
I mean, the floodplain regs are an insurance thing, so it's all about value.
And if they're paying their insurance, right.
Then...
The county gives us the insurance account, and there's an increase in the value, you said,
the building permits the county sees that you're doing a building, so they increase your
property value, your taxes go up, and insurance company wants to know if you're increasing
the property value so they can raise your insurance premium.
So that's the downside of it.
People's insurance premiums would go up on that one, but...
Right.
Well, if you read that bottom program or part, it's cumulative change.
So it's a 50% limit.
We have hard questions before we start.
Yeah.
Well, again, this is something that I guess above and beyond what the minimums are.
I just didn't remember endorsing that part of it.
That could be wrong.
Meanwhiles.
Senator Dawn, thank you, Ms. Parkinson's.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, we do have a couple of items.
We'll be dealing with floodplain.
Obviously, through the public hearing process, as you observe, there is a schedule to keep
with that, and therefore we'll keep to that schedule.
And the second thing is the public hearing on the chicken ordinance.
Now, note that you've received some correspondence here this evening that we passed on to you
from an interested citizen, but those are the two items presently that are on your 16th
agenda.
We'll make sure there are one that our commissioners are not here tonight, we'll get
that letter.
Yes.
Okay.
Thank you.
Since that brings us to the end, I'll take a motion to adjourn.
Do I have a second?
All those in favor?
Hi.
Hi.
We're adjourned.
