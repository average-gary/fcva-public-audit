I am all ears.
I'd like to know what your needs are.
But before I can help you out, I need to know where you stand.
Thanks.
All right, sir.
Item number A under our budget resolution.
B and C.
And some information at the end of our meeting.
Entertainment motion adopted, agenda is presented.
Motion to second.
Second.
Second.
All is in favor.
Mr chairman.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Before we go.
Discussion.
I would just like to have supervisors comments added to the end after we have the work session.
Okay.
If I may.
So.
Motion concur to be amended.
Supervisors comments just prior to item three adjourned.
I didn't hear.
I thought I was a second.
I thought you were the second also.
You made the motion to adopt the agenda.
Are you okay with the amendment?
Yes, sir.
I am.
On the team.
Not too long.
Sir.
Second.
I need to further discussion.
All those in favor.
Aye.
Opposed?
No.
I will adopt the agenda.
That will bring us to our work session discussion.
Budget resolution.
Yes, sir.
Budget.
Budget.
There we go.
Beginning back in November.
The board's met numerous times leading up to tonight.
There was a consensus amongst the board or majority of the board to advertise a five cent tax increase which has taken place.
And you're slated to adopt a budget next week at your regular meeting on April 8th.
Obviously with the events of the day and this coronavirus.
You know, the entire world's kind of been turned upside down and we're adjusting as needed.
And as best we can to those circumstances.
We know that our revenue in some areas is going to be impacted.
The most obvious being meals and lodging.
We have some information for you regarding that which I can get into in a little bit more detail.
I'm going to add a little bit more to that.
I'm going to add a little bit more to that.
Knowing that some of the board is expressed concern based on the circumstances on the proposed budget.
What we've done is amended the resolution that the board would adopt as you adopt the budget.
And if you look at that resolution, you'll see that we've added a column A and a column B.
It's for the five cent tax increase.
Column B reverts back to scenario A, which was a budget scenario that included no tax increase and kept us at the current rate.
The areas that you see highlighted in the pink color are the categories that would change as a result of that adjustment.
The staff's request to the board obviously is that you give some thought to where you want to go.
It may be something other than column A or column B, but those are the two that seem most obvious to staff.
Ultimately, you don't have to make a decision tonight, but when you adopt a budget next week, we would want to have a resolution in there that reflects what it is you desire to do.
That's because of revenue and where we are.
Unfortunately, you know, this virus has come upon us rather suddenly, and the impacts really are kind of yet to be determined.
You know, locally, I would say that we began to feel the impacts in mid to late March.
We don't have revenue data yet to know exactly what those impacts are going to be, but I'll give you just some bits of information that help, I hope, put this into perspective.
We have a monthly March for our inspections department.
They brought in $180,000 in the month of March, which is nearly a record month.
We've been averaging around 120,000 a month in revenue and inspections.
This time, revenue has hit that high for a month, was back in March of 2006.
Up until March, at least, the building community was still going strong.
We don't know, obviously, what's going to happen moving forward, but we anticipate that our revenue for that department will actually be up this year, at year end.
So revenue, which tends to reflect the building community, is also up parks and rec.
Revenue is going to be down and significantly down, obviously.
All the parks and rec programs have been canceled for the remainder of the year.
We expect so, you know, all the revenue they derive supports a great deal of that parks and rec department budget.
That's going to take a hit and we know that.
If you look towards the end of your packet, we prepared a pie chart just to give you some sense of where our revenue comes from.
And you can see that the two largest percentages, 38% of our revenue comes from general property taxes.
Personal property, real estate, 30% comes from state revenue.
And then the pie piece up towards the top, the reddish color combined to sales meals and lodging.
Those three taxes account for only six and a half percent of our revenue.
I think the point being that if meals and lodging and sales are down, for us, it's significant, but it's not anywhere near as significant as some of these other categories because it makes up such a small percentage of the overall budget.
6.5% of a $343 million budget is about $22 million.
We're eight months into the year.
So if you assume that for the next four months that revenue drops dramatically and you can pick a percent or a number, the impact in the overall budget is not as significant as it would be if it were a drop in some of these other categories.
General property tax is the 38% as of right now.
Well, at 38%, that's $131 million of the $343 million budget.
So again, trying to put it in perspective.
The anticipation is personal property tax will be up about $3 million this year.
And real estate will be up a million and a half.
Now, those are these sus values.
That's not what we collect, but obviously we would hope to collect most if not all of that.
So the reason I provide that information is just again to kind of put it in perspective as to what does it mean to the county if the restaurant meals tax is down dramatically for the remainder of the year.
Now, again, what none of us know is how long is this situation going to persist?
You know, is it going to get into the summer and summer months?
We don't know and we don't know what the overall impact will be.
So from this staff's perspective, you know, it would be our desire and we realize we don't get a vote, but our desire would be that we proceed and set a tax rate and adopt a budget next week.
We need be come July when hopefully the dust has settled.
If we find that we've been hit far worse than we thought, we'll have to go back and adjust and amend budgets accordingly.
But right now, it feels premature to me to make dramatic adjustments in a budget when we really don't know what we're dealing with.
So that's my perspective and my perspective alone.
And we're looking for the board really at this point for guidance and what you'd like from us and we can answer questions.
We'll certainly try and do that.
Let's start with questions.
Questions, Mr. Tierney, anyone?
Yes, sir.
Those are done.
And you may not be able to give us, but on the state portion of the budget, which is some 30%.
Do you have any idea of approximately how that or may or may not be affected?
Or if you don't, do you know when you're going to figure out or find out?
No, not thinking about it. Find out what adjustment that will occur.
I've heard that it's going to be down. I've heard it's not going to be down. So best thoughts.
I honestly don't know. I mean, I don't know that anybody knows the answer to that question quite honestly.
I certainly don't.
And then the other comment is that if we set a tax rate next week, we can come back.
And depending upon what our revenue is in July, August, September, we can adjust this accordingly.
Out the rate.
No, not the rate. I'm talking about the budget.
The budget itself.
Correct. Right.
And what dollars we have.
Because we only have, we only have dollars that are going to come in for revenue.
Or we're going to have to go into the line of credit where we have to make some adjustments.
Well, you know, again, my suggestion is that we, we wait and see where we are.
We have a very healthy reserve.
You know, the last few years, we've been fortunate. We haven't had to dip into that.
But we have a very healthy fund balance.
You know, our history has been that at the end of every year, we, we return money.
Usually in the millions, a couple million.
So it's, I think it's too early to say where we're going to be at year end.
But certainly, if, if revenue takes a big hit, and we, and we can't afford the budget that ends up being adopted,
then we'll have to go back and modify that budget and adjust accordingly.
Thank you.
That was great.
Mr. Chair.
Mr. Chair, any question for you?
The reserves as I understand it, we have approximately two months worth of reserves.
Is that correct?
Yes.
Yes, we have about 39 million in reserves. That's our unreserved fund balance.
We also have the funds that we pushed out of that for capital.
And there's about seven, seven and a half million. That's not part of that.
So how long would we last as a county on that as far as if revenue stopped today?
How long does that carry? Is that two months worth of bills? How long is that?
It's two months.
Two months.
Thank you.
Questions of staff?
Comments? Anyone?
The proposal is done.
Shriffler.
But we are going to get money in July.
I mean, we will get a block of money.
So the two months situation is not...
We'll get some additional money in July.
So we won't know where we are until that money comes in, correct?
We will get additional money from where, in July.
Real estate tax?
Oh, in June.
Yes, I pop well.
Yes, normally it's in June.
Okay.
That's correct.
What else?
I have a small...
Surprise or great?
Yes, sir.
I have a small presentation that I'd prepared just for us to consider and talk about.
If now's a good time.
Works?
Works.
All right.
So what I've done is went back and looked a little bit at some of the investment.
Things, partners that I've dealt with.
And I've brought a few things to light that I'd like to see us as a board consider.
And it is by no means where I am.
It's just something I'd like to have us look at and hopefully get feedback from everyone
regarding where you see us as a budget.
Personally, I don't want to see a tax increase when so many of my constituents are struggling.
I've received a lot of phone calls and a lot of emails and it's been some pretty heartbreaking stories.
So that's personally where I'm at just so everyone is aware.
If you go to the next slide there, sir.
So at the bottom there is from Charles Schwab.
A reddit in depth article from them regarding what they felt and a lot of the large banks and brokerage firms felt
that our economy may look like the second quarter of 2020, which would be our fourth quarter in the books.
As you see at the very top is Bloomberg economics at 9% downward.
All the way down from capital economics at the bottom of 40% downward projected revenue or as far as projected GDP for the second quarter.
I'm not saying that I believe either the top or the bottom a lot of times when I look at things I've tried to poke a pencil somewhere in the middle and been a lot closer to being accurate.
So if I were to poke something in the middle of 10% to 40%.
Here's somewhere in the neighborhood of 20, 25% GDP estimate down and that's what I've read from a lot of places.
Next slide please.
There's a lot of things I've looked at to try to help our residents and constituents and I don't know that anyone is better than another.
But I had some things that I did want us to at least think about or consider.
I know that the board of supervisors in Fairfax County is considering delaying their personal property and real estate deadline for the first half of the year to August the 28th.
I know that that's something that's being circulated pretty strongly.
I'd like to kind of at least have some thought process into what are our thoughts on having the real estate and personal property tax deadline being June 5th.
And I don't think we need to make a decision tonight.
I think it's something we probably need to look at the first of May and kind of see how this thing plays out over the next month.
But I do believe that it's something we need to think about.
Is it realistic to extend at 30 days, 45 days or 60 days?
And the reason for my thought process is this.
If everyone stays home as the president has outlined on Sunday for 30 days, that gets us to the end of April.
So if everyone goes back to work the first of May, it essentially gives small businesses and folks to be back on the job approximately 30 days.
Most folks who are in small business, I know a lot of you are, you're on a 30 day billing cycle.
So if you do work in May and you have a 30 day billing cycle, you're not going to start to see a lot of that revenue until June or early July.
So my question is, is this worth considering or thinking about?
Next slide.
The numbers that I received here are from our finance director's office and I appreciate them working so hard to get me these numbers.
So what does a reduction from our current budget, the one we're in right now or fourth quarter that started today?
What does it look like? Well, the general fund remaining funds are there at $33 million.
And as you see, the little dot off to the side says does not include salaries, fringes or the Alvin convenience center.
You see what a 5% reduction does to our budget and how much it would save us.
I would like to see us consider either a 5% or a 10% reduction in light of what we could be seeing as far as a reduction in revenue, but at the state level or from the state level and also from local funds.
I don't think we need to cut public safety or social services or even our debt transfer for the schools or the county data.
I want to make sure that we pay our debts as we need to.
However, all of our other departments and our school operating transfer, I believe we could cut 10% schools or not in session.
We're not running buses right now.
So I believe that a 5% to 10% cut and if we did 10% and excluded public safety and excluded our debt transfer, it would actually be somewhere in the neighborhood of an actual 7.5% budget cut for just this fourth quarter.
But even if we were to do a true 10% budget cut for this fourth quarter, it would only be an actual 2.5% cut to the entire budget on a 12 month basis.
Next. So that was just reiterating what I said.
If you actually cut things 10% for the fourth quarter, it's an actual 2.5% overall cut for the year.
And as I understand it, it would not necessarily affect the salaries of our staff, which I would not want to see it do.
Next slide.
I'd like to see us really look at some figures for 2021. I ask our finance director at our last board of supervisors meeting to give us some numbers of what a 3% of 5% and a 10% budget cut would look like for next year.
And she so graciously provided this for us.
As we look across here, and I'm not set on any of the three numbers that are presented, but if you look at what has been projected from Charles Schwab and some of the others out there.
If we were to do a 5% cut to everything except for public safety and for social services and our service or debt, it would actually be about a 3.5% actual cut.
If we did a 10% cut and excluded those same agencies, it would actually be again about a 7.5% cut.
But I really believe that we need to take a long hard look at what our projected revenues may or may not be in speaking with a lot of the small business owners in my district and receiving phone calls from them.
Some of their businesses are off as much as 70%. Some of them are all 50%. They're having some real struggles right now.
And I believe that we need to be mindful of that as we set our budget for next year.
I think that we should look at a 5% or 10% cut and I'm open to hearing any suggestions anyone may have.
And if we see that the revenues are considerably higher, then we can adjust our budget accordingly and decide from that point where we want to go.
My concern is if we've already spent the money, we have to pay for those things that we've spent the money on.
And it's even if we adjust our budget at that point, we're already behind the eight ball.
If we adjust our budget now, it gives us the opportunity if revenue is above what we think it might be.
It gives us the opportunity to change our budget and I haven't heard anybody complain when they get a little more money than what they had anticipated.
So I think that it would be who of us to take a good hard look at what these numbers are in and see if a 5% or a 10% reduction is in line.
There's just some thoughts.
Next slide, please.
I've spoken about everything here except for the very bottom line and the very bottom line is as all budgets could be cut in my opinion with the exception of servicing our county debt and our school debt.
I think we need to have a good hard discussion as a board on where we stand and how we expect our citizens to pay with many of them being in the unemployment line.
If you look at our unemployment numbers for last week, they were higher than they'd ever been during the Great Depression.
I think that we need to be mindful of that as we set the tax rate and as we go forward.
Thank you so much for your time.
Thank you.
Budget resolution.
You covered adequately.
You want a discussion about it?
I think we're I've said what I felt I'm certainly here for that answers my question.
Whatever direction we're given questions.
Thank you.
We do need to be prepared with resolution on Wednesday the 8th.
In an ideal world, it will go out on Friday with the agenda.
So if you folks are willing to have a discussion about that subject, I think it would be beneficial certainly help staff.
Well, and just for clarification, it wouldn't be the first time we put two buzzer resolutions in the agenda.
Okay.
Well, we know what we want on.
Exactly.
That was going to be my point.
If there's something other than one of these two that we would need to know that.
I'm in.
Anyone?
Bear with me.
Supervisor slaughter.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Are you with us?
Yes.
Thank you.
Thank you both.
Who's going to have a comment if I could ask?
Yes.
Please.
Just to follow up on.
Mr. Tierney's comment regarding sort of taking a wait and see.
I'm leaning a towards, well, I've always leaned towards not having a tax increase this year.
I think it's no imperative more than ever with the current situation with the economy that we not raise taxes as a time when people are losing their jobs.
My concern with not cutting or not being prepared for reduced revenues is twofold.
One is if we know right now that we're probably going to have two, three, potentially four months of no revenues from the food service industry, a three month.
Laws are somewhere between five and six million dollars.
A four month loss is somewhere around seven million dollars.
So any additional revenues that we're planning to take in from increased assessments, values, or what other tax revenues we're planning on getting are potentially going to be wiped out by the fact that the restaurants and the hotels and food industry aren't operating for those three to four months.
So then my next question is if we don't have that additional revenue and we're not raising taxes.
We need to start considering what we do if other revenues also get hit.
I do think that it could be misleading to just wait until after the June tax revenues come in because most of those tax revenues or good portion of those tax revenues are paid through escrow accounts with the mortgage companies.
So most people are paying those accounts up about six months in advance.
So when you go to buy a house, you're paying three to six months into your escrow account in advance just for potentially pieces or homeowners insurance increases.
So the banks will have plenty of money in those escrow accounts to pay the June taxes.
So the most concern though is what happens in December and the people stop paying the mortgage payments now and those escrow accounts start to dry up and the banks don't have escrow balances to pay the taxes come December.
So I hate for us to deceive ourselves into thinking that our June revenues looks good and we're in good shape and the virus is gone and things are going to be one better footing and be deceived by the fact that there may be a lot of money not coming into the mortgage companies.
So I don't know what the right number is.
I agree with supervisor grave that there should probably be some cuts put in up front and then we can always come back later and fund with additional revenues that we then we can always come back.
And we can always increase the budgets. I'd rather cut now and increase later than spend too much now and trying to decrease later.
But I don't know what the right number is. I don't know if it's 10% that seems steep to me.
But 5% or 3% I think would be a reasonable tightening of the belt.
So to speak to make sure that we're prepared for the contingency if this thing continues to last for another two, three, four, six months.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, if I could.
The meals tax last year brought in 5.4 million.
And through February, we had derived 3.8.
So if we get zero collections from meals for the next four months, the impact is what about a million and a half.
So if we're lodging last year, we brought in 700,000.
And through February, we already collected 600,000.
So if we don't collect anything for the remaining four months, we're out $100,000.
So I just wanted to get those numbers out there.
And thank you, Sharon. I must have misunderstood. When you said 5 or 6 million, I thought you meant that would be the loss, not the toll.
I apologize.
This past week it projected 1.6 million hit.
4th quarter.
4th case.
That's assuming no collections at all.
And that's only for this year?
Yes.
That's through the end of the year, yes, sir.
3rd.
Correct.
Okay.
Other comments?
Concerns, thoughts?
But I am a member of the construction industry.
I was talking earlier with folks.
And it seems that everyone says our building permits are up.
It's kind of the hoarding principle taking place.
Everybody wants to get those houses built before the incomes.
Get it in, get it up, get it finished, and get it sold as quickly as you possibly can.
We saw the same thing happen at the recession, and then you saw the glut that it brought.
So it's just the way the building industry runs itself.
And we're seeing it again.
A lot of pressure on everyone to go as fast as you possibly can, because we don't know what the next situation is.
The main thing is going to affect them is going to be financing.
And people being able to get money to purchase a home.
Several years ago, when we went through the downturn, we kept everything in revenue neutral, as you all know.
And that was fine.
The only problem is, is at some point in time in your life cycle, you start coming back.
And we were starting to make a comeback.
And now here we go again.
I think if we...
I'm not worried about too much about making cuts, but I am worried about looking at the future and saying,
what's going to happen if we move backwards?
How far is that going to set us back in the future when we have to move ahead?
And we will have to move ahead at some point in time.
So we're still playing catch-up from the last time we went through this scenario.
And if we go back again, we're going to play even farther catch-up.
So I'm looking at it from a standpoint of business man looking at a standpoint as tax payer and the future of our county.
I'm having a difficult time figuring out where the dollars are going to come to support
our infrastructure of our county system, if you will, without some sort of a tax increase.
So I'm not convinced that we can do what we need to do for the future for the county without some sort of a tax increase to offset some of the things.
That's my opinion.
Thank you, sir. Anyone else willing to share? She provides her Fisher.
Mr. Chairman, this is very troubling and difficult times trying to figure it because we really don't know.
We can sit here at hypothesize all night long. We're not going to know where we're going really with forest revenues.
But budgets are a guideline.
We've already been through this once in 2008. You get a budget, but when revenues change, you change your budget accordingly.
I think to make any changes right now, the significant things of three or five or ten percent, you're talking about people.
You're not talking about toilet paper or paper towels or supplies. You're talking about some real pain.
I think we need to move forward with some type of a budget. I've been going over the scenario A.
I think unfortunately our employees, or I think we got some really good employees, but I think for this year we're going to have to hold the line on salary wage increases.
If you do that in that scenario, you can take those funds and transfer it into a budget line item for your six firemen and EMTs.
I think we should delete the recreation part-time staff at Jordan Springs. I think we should fund the SOR position at Jordan Springs if the school is operational.
I think we should budget for the sheriff's investigator. We should delete the sunny side contractual services.
That one. That is a contract.
It needs to be put on hold. It's already been.
There's a lot of folks out there putting the brakes on things. I'm saying we can't have that discussion with the contractor, but the contract's been finalized.
I'm just sharing. I know that there's a lot of business people out there that are drawing the line and saying, well, we're this far. We'll quit here.
My just a suggestion. We would try to support the hauling of recycling materials as much as we could.
And looking at stormwater fees and inspection fees, I would raise those things to the to the hilt.
The state challenges. I think they need to go up to because they reflect what's happening when we have to build these residents and stuff.
And I think those fees need to be raised quite a bit.
And with the shortage possibly of the meals and lodging, I think, you know, looking at what that is on an annual basis. If we lose a quarter of it, I would think fund balance could make up that at least for a year.
Anyhow, didn't mean to get into so many details there. Now, the funding for the school system.
I just want to remind this board that we cannot control the expenditures or allocations of the school system's budget. We can only give them a certain amount of funds.
I do have respect for the difficult job that the schools have to do.
I don't like to think, but I haven't heard back that the school board and administration would hold the line on pay raises.
Of course, you have to love what the state does to them. It gives them a pay raise for teachers, but then only funds about what is it a third of it or something.
And you know where the rest of that has to come from.
So I could get on my bandwagon about the cost of school buildings, but I think everybody knows where I stand on that over the years.
My main interest is we built a new school. It would be sinful not to open that building.
So I think we need to provide them. And I think if you look on scenario, you'd get about 2.7 million to open the Jordan Spring schools.
But when I say that, you got to understand we give them money, but how they choose to spend it, we've got no control over.
But it certainly would make that known that that's what we would like them to use it for.
And then I think at the end of the year, if any surplus funds they've got, we've normally given them that for their capital expenditures.
So while I was the one that initiated the five cent tax increase, I think with the current scenario,
somebody will have to do a lot of arm twisting for me to have a tax increase this year.
That's where I am today and probably will be next week.
And I am opposed to delaying any of this. It's just pushing stuff down the road that won't do us any good.
We don't know what's coming. We need to get on with the program here, approve our budget.
And if July 1 rolls around and we see things happening, I have, you know, with the staff of Mr. Tierney, our finance director, treasure,
I've got no problem with that going to handle the situation and come and recommend how they would get the budget back in line.
Sorry. Didn't mean to go over so long.
You did good, I think.
So just for my own satisfaction, did I get this right?
You wanted to pull the investigator back over the SOR, the six firefighters, the environmental inspector was already there,
the deputy director's security.
T was already there and you want to strike the basic rep.
It wrecked PT at Jordan Springs.
Is that?
Yes.
Okay.
So that's the basic wreck at Jordan Springs as residents are shooting.
So up there, it has three points.
Yes.
We're driving in the air.
How much is that?
It was close to 200.
So it's kind of a...
Yes.
Well, you blew 200,000.
I'm sorry.
Oh, it's helpful.
Just another detail.
I believe, and I apologize, I didn't bring my notebook with me, but I believe the money for sunny side is simply the operating costs and there's revenue associated with that too because we have tenants in there.
So that's utilities and things of that nature.
It's not redo in the building.
So it was property management, correct?
Yeah, that would be in there as well.
Okay, then I'm misinterpreted that.
I stand corrected.
Thank you.
Okay.
Hey, down through your list again.
I'm sorry.
So you're taking scenario A and you are...
Okay, so this 3% that was...
That 3% that was health insurance.
That's already been reduced by 150,000.
So you're taking the 2% mayor and you're taking that out and you're adding what?
Well, the six firefighters EMTs.
Okay.
The SRO position at Jordan Springs.
Okay.
If the school opens the sheriff investigator.
Okay.
And then trying to cover the hauling recycling cost.
But that was a $300,000 number.
I'm not sure I covered that.
Okay.
It should be closed.
You can always stagger those employees in fire and rescue if you need to.
What I really like to put in but couldn't would be two floaters for firefighters at EMTs.
But that can't happen there.
Other than I feel that that probably would cut into the overtime.
But not that much.
And not right away.
No.
Well, any other thing is on this hiring of these employees.
I wouldn't start doing it till July 1.
So that would delay the impact probably six weeks.
Till you would hire folks.
We couldn't start until July 1 anyway.
But I'm saying if we waited and started the hiring process.
Are you starting the process?
They would delay.
They would have back into that and see what would happen.
So if you have an approach, maybe get a month and a half.
So I can, I mean, if that's what is being requested.
We're going to try to determine that.
I can, I can just tell you what that means.
I can, I can tell you what that means.
We were all sort of on the same page.
We're, we're the discussion started.
Okay.
And thank you for your help.
Because that's what we really need.
We need you to tell us what we really can and can do.
Okay.
Thank you.
Supervisor Dyn.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Just one comment in regard to Mr. Fisher's list.
And one of the things that we had been talking about.
And I think particularly in light of the position where the,
the fire and respucations will be.
And the assistance with your fuel this year may be more imperative than any year.
Because they're fundraising activities will be cut dramatically.
So, I mean, if we're putting a list here of, of things that have high importance.
I, I think the fuel assistance would be extremely important to those organizations.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Supervisor Dyn.
Mr. Chappell, jazz.
I have trouble hearing.
So, earlier, Mr. Chappell, you had, you had anticipated.
Something like $6 million of new revenue coming into the county.
I'm not holding you to it.
I'm, was that about, that was about the.
So, we had the natural revenue increase of 4.7.
Okay.
And then we had the 5.5 increase from the tax rate.
That we were going to adjust.
And then when we looked at permits and all the other increases that are kind of like driven by programs,
whether it's parks programs, that was another 1.8.
Okay. So, the parks program plus the natural 4.5, 6.2 on getting ballpark.
My question.
The, the 4.7 was shared.
So, our, our portion of that 4.7 was 2.
So, if you take the 2 in the 1.8 that I just said as other revenue,
that's why we start at 3.8 in the scenario A.
Okay.
Does that make sense?
Yes. Okay.
Now, and I know you're not a seer.
What do you expect over the next 12 months or 6 months one that I do?
Do you think that's a realistic number?
Well, I'll put it in the spot.
Which is that's what, what do you think that realistically that 3.8 might be, you know, half or,
three quarters of that, best guess.
And you've been good on that, but I'm not, you know, best guess when what you think
from a budget purpose, we ought to anticipate.
So, so the 4.7 is mostly driven by property taxes and sale.
We didn't have a lot of increase in sales tax because we increased it so much last year.
So, a large portion of that is driven by your property taxes.
Which aren't as fragile normally as your market driven permits, sales tax, utility tax,
meals tax, all those.
If we had no tax increase, you think that we might have some place in the neighborhood of $3 million,
and suppose the 3.8, I'm not trying, I'm just trying to get, I'm trying to get an idea
of how much additional revenue you think from natural growth and fees we would get this year
over last year because of what we're going through now.
How much more are we getting 2020?
No, how much more are we going to get in 2021 because of this virus issue from your...
Yeah, I don't think I can answer that one.
Okay.
I think that your property taxes revenue is probably more safe than your other.
And your others, as we talked about, was 5% of the budget.
So, that gives you more comfort than if it was that larger piece of the pie.
One of the things that just bring up is we were talking, Mr. Tierney brought up the fact,
in fact, our landfill rates are up because we're dumping a lot of housing garbage in it.
And our housing starts are up, so we're seeing permitting fees and that kind of thing going up at high levels.
The construction industry is a big part.
If we didn't learn our lesson way back when we better learn, we better, you know, don't go backwards.
Let's take a look at it.
The construction industry is a driving force in further county.
A lot of people don't like houses.
A lot of people don't like people coming in, but it does drive our economy.
It's jobs and it's income to the county that comes in.
So, when you start talking about raising fees and putting the squeeze on the builder,
you can't do a certain point, but then you get to a point where you drive yourself out of the market.
And if you're looking around now, the starting as low as $2.99, $300,000, that kind of thing.
When you attach a fee, it only goes one place to the bottom line.
So, if you add $50,000 to every house, does that push the market where it's not a further county's market jet?
And with this downturn that we're seeing now, my fear is that we're going to see a situation with the housing market.
I hope it doesn't happen, but I'm just looking ahead and saying, I think it's going to have a real strong downturn effect on the housing market.
I just, if it stops in another month, we're probably okay after that.
I think our whole economy is in trouble.
National economy is in trouble.
Thank you, sir.
Don't think Supervisor Wells meant to interrupt you.
I'm sorry.
Little slut.
Mr. Wells, we're fine.
We need those months.
Okay, I have one.
We're good.
We're fine.
We need more but.
We're fine.
We just have an conversation.
So, the reason I asked Mrs. Schiffler the comments, I was just thinking about through scenarios.
I'm leaning toward saying that this year, this upcoming year, that we take the revenue that we had from last year.
Same, same dollar amount.
The same dollar amounts go to the schools and same dollar amounts go to the county.
If that gives us then $3 million or whatever, an unknown figure, then come August, September, July.
And sometimes it's down the road.
We would have that money that we can then reallocate to where we have needs.
But right now, if the revenue is unknown, then my thought process might be simply to go and say,
If in this year, we had $100 going to the county and last year, we had $100 going to the schools,
put that there.
The additional revenue comes in and see where we are with that revenue.
And then allocate and see what happens with the state.
I've heard that the state revenue will be down.
I don't know that.
But that's, you know, I heard that.
So, that's kind of what I'm trying to deal with.
If we have to come up with a budget, Mr. Graber's comments about making a cut.
I'm open to that for the simple reason that I think that this quarter here is not reflective of what we're seeing.
So if in the next few months we have significant hits, far better to anticipate that now than to play catch up.
And then Mr. Wells, you know, for your comments about down the road, I'm saying this is a smile.
Join me on saying, you know, let's see if we can get some revisions on impact fees or capital cost recovery or something like that.
And we have to deal with the issues, I think, of additional revenue besides real estate taxes.
And that's dealing long term, not for this budget, but long term.
It is long term.
So I'm not thinking about that right now.
Not that you and I have discussed it.
I'm just saying my pitch.
I'm just saying that so far down the road at this time, for this budget.
I mean, it may be a year down the road, but for this particular budget, it's kind of outweighed.
So, and when we get down, I don't mind looking at cutting, I'm a businessman and sometimes you have to do that.
But I don't know that we need to do that today on the start of this budget.
I think we can do that as we look as we go through the budget.
So with Mr. Graber's numbers up there, you know, rather than starting out making the cuts before we really know where we are,
I don't think I want to go there, but we don't mind looking at it as we see our adjusted income come in.
Then that's when you look at and say, hey, we got to make some moves here.
And it's people.
So what Jean said, it's nothing, you know, you're not going to find paper towels and that kind of thing that are going to save you that kind of money.
You're looking at people and those are tough cuts, you know, for anyone.
So I say we hold on to that.
It's a good discussion to have, but not make them right this minute at part of this coming coming budget when we pass this budget.
I'll just say that come July, August, September.
We can have another conversation because we're going to go into another legislative session for tonight.
And next week, I agree with you that it's, you know, that's not the solution for this week.
But for next year, at least I like to have put that on the table for discussion.
Right.
Mr. Graber.
Mr. Chairman, I really appreciate the comments that Mr. Supervisor Don made.
If we were to hold the line and do resolution B and have exactly the same amount of money this coming years, we had this last year.
If there are additional revenues realized, it would allow us to really fund some things that Mr. Fisher, Supervisor Fisher identified the firefighters and some other things.
I just, as I stated earlier, have a real hard time spending money and then saying, okay, now we're going to cut from this point forward.
Once we've already got ourselves maybe into a hole.
If we were able to hold the line.
If revenues, as we're getting into July and August, look stable and we're able to see an increase above and beyond this year's budget.
Then at that point, we can take those revenues and put those to the needs that we see.
But I think that Supervisor Don's approach is a good approach.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Other thoughts, anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Fisher, one item of capital that I think we're all in agreement with.
Mr. Fisher, that stays on the table.
The radio is the communication.
I think it was 6.8, I think.
Mr. Fisher, is that right?
Six points.
This funds are not included in the revolution.
Right.
I'm saying that's one of the things that we definitely want to do though.
But that's on the side.
There is funds set aside in the capital reserve.
That is equivalent.
It's actually a little more than that.
But we haven't even got all those numbers back from our RFP yet.
Other thoughts?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
Supervisor Schlar.
One last thought I had.
I'm sitting here going through all of our budget information.
And I do remember Mrs. Green making her presentation regarding the DSS manager.
And I feel very certain with everything that this world is going through at this time,
that is still a very important funding necessity.
And part of that in looking at this information,
it looked like a percentage would come from the state,
but the county then would need to fund an additional portion of that.
So if we add things to this list of things of importance,
the most important things, again, as Mr. Fisher said, the firefighter is the EMC.
We also need to add the DSS manager.
They're talking about making sure all of this information is processed in the right possible way.
So if we could add that to Mrs. Chippler's list of seeing how we could balance all of this.
And I guess the only other question I have in regards to scenario A,
did we have a contingency fund at all built into scenario A?
I'd have to look back.
I think that we had 300 in the current year.
So when you don't add, when there's not an increase,
I think it still maintains 300.
I'd have to check that out for sure.
Okay, Cheryl.
Thank you so much.
All right.
It's a great discussion.
I think we probably need to attempt to try to feel some type of direction.
Professor Fisher stated his position on rate.
Do you think we can try to reach a consensus on that one?
Yes, sir.
On capital funding, one of the items that Mrs. Slaughter talked about on capital funding
was moving money so the schools could still have capital funding for the list of items.
I mean, I think that's important on that capital.
Are you talking about the proper funds?
Yes.
They were advertised and they're part of this resolution in both scenarios.
To a consensus on rate.
Professor Fisher stated his supervisor McCarthy,
would you care to state your position on rate?
I would hold the rate at its current rate.
Thank you, sir.
Supervisor Dunn.
I'll hold the position at the same rate as it currently exists.
Current rate.
And supervisor Graver?
Current rates, sir.
Okay.
So that's a majority.
So that's what we want to use as a basis.
Okay.
So.
Yes, go ahead.
Okay.
That's the question I want to try to answer.
Okay.
So I'm working on a resolution that's pretty much based on B here, which is our current tax rate.
So again, I didn't hear.
The resolution we've based on the 61 cent tax rate,
which is the one's a speed.
It's in pink.
And beyond.
And then am I supposed to be taken scenario A in try to address some of the things that were discussed tonight?
Or is that for something at a later date?
Well,
we're going to try to answer that question.
Okay.
So personal preference would be to see if you can address the comments that were made this evening, which looks to me like seven people.
If my list is correct.
And.
And adding the fire and rescue fuel.
See, see how close you can get to that.
I had six firefighters.
I was adding.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
My number was incorrect.
Okay.
I had an SRO.
Seven.
Seven lion items.
Okay.
You had six firefighters.
SRO.
SRO.
And I have a DSS benefit manager.
And I have a sheriff investigator.
That's what the.
That's what I wrote down as well as a question.
Okay.
And already in is the RT deputy security.
And the environmental inspector.
And the basic.
Correct.
I'm sorry.
The environmental inspector is already in scenario A.
So you wouldn't be adding that.
Those.
Environmental inspector in the IT deputy for security are in the.
Right.
Right.
We're not adding that.
Right.
Got it.
My head was right.
My verb words were wrong.
And then I'm also trying to look at the recycling contract.
Is that what our community will be very disappointed if we can't continue that.
I would let it go before I'd let one of these people were talking about fall off.
But let's try see where you can get.
Okay.
We can.
Can.
Can you do that and send it out to the board?
Does.
You all tell me whether this scenario makes sense to you.
I asked to do that.
Send it out to us as a board.
Get us some feedback.
Go ahead.
Well, we we can certainly try and make it work.
But.
You know, I think it's going to be very challenging to get everything you've asked for in there.
I would agree.
Let's see where we can get.
We will certainly attempt to do that.
See what other possibilities exist.
My goal would be to have a consensus by Friday for the agenda.
Go ahead.
Supervisor Dun.
On that list that you have.
And I thought Mr. Dunnard had an area.
I thought I could be wrong.
I thought Mr. Chair, you had 400,000 in contingencies in this current budget.
But one of the items that we talked about was IT.
And Mr. Barnard made the comment that if we get hit with a malware attack, etc.
That that person is really critical.
So I'm not saying that we have to have it.
But I like Mr. Terry to go through the spot.
It's in there.
It's in there.
It's in there.
It started in there.
So it wasn't added because it was already in there.
All right.
That's why we hadn't talked about it was already in.
She brought it here.
I just asked one question.
Surely.
You're asking one question.
No, no.
I was just going to ask.
Because I just before you go.
Go ahead.
Just so I know where I'm at.
Right.
All right.
We've taken part scenario A and scenario B.
I'm A.
And combine some.
Is that what we're doing?
So we took some.
So this is what I understand.
I understand that we took scenario A.
We took out the merit cola.
Right.
And we added positions and recycling.
And we're trying to see if that works.
Okay.
So we're on A really.
Pretty much.
That's where we are.
I just wanted to be sure that I would want.
Thank you.
Mr. Gray.
Is that.
Is that where everybody else is too?
Just.
We're.
We're trying to get all the way to the end.
I apologize.
I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.
I also had fuel for a volunteer fire.
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
What?
Fuel for the.
The fuel assistance program.
I just saying what I heard.
On list.
Yeah.
Did hear it.
From two of it.
Two hundred thousand.
Two hundred.
Two hundred.
That's what I thought of as well.
I don't know.
Yes.
Okay.
We'll put it on the list.
Supervisor Graber.
Thank you very much.
Yeah.
Sorry.
You're fine.
You were looking for consensus there.
I could support everything under scenario A with the exception of all the add-ons that have been added on this evening.
So the six firefighters.
The hauling and recycling.
The DSS manager.
The recycling contract.
All those things.
I could not support because I believe that we need to keep our budget similar last year.
And if there are additional revenues and we come back and that's in September or if that's in January.
And look at these needs and address them.
But I cannot support anything.
Other than what is in the original.
scenario A.
As is presented.
So if you wanted to know it's not going to change between now.
Next Wednesday.
Thank you.
We're going to try to get it.
But thank you.
Other comments.
Does that mean you're supporting the pay raise?
You said everything else in scenario A.
I would not support the pay raise.
And I know that that's going to free up a little bit of money and I'm okay with that.
Yeah, that's the whole.
To me.
That's the whole idea I was using for any of those things that I added was trying to make it balanced.
I'm not trying to increase any.
Which is like getting a tight.
That's a million dollars.
I understand.
Yeah.
All right.
Other comments.
The general comment.
On fire and rescue.
I know that.
The fire and rescue community has some concerns on fundraising because of what we're going through.
So the bingo games are occurring.
The sales of products and services, you know, which generate or not occurring.
I know they made a request for additional money.
I'm not there either.
I think we have as a community have to be cognizant of that.
And that those volunteers are volunteers.
Their equipment is all paid for by themselves.
So when they have an ambulance coming to your house, their aim is not a county paid ambulance.
It's $250,000, $300,000, et cetera.
So for those that are listening, maybe you're aware of the fact that a donation to the fire up to the volunteer fire rescue system is appropriate.
And then we as board members, I don't know how to address that.
But if their funding goes down, it has a direct effect on us.
And so if there's a way to address that in a constructive way, I think it's just something we need to address.
That's one comment.
The other comment is, at least in my looking at the stuff in the last four years, I've been on the board.
The only growth people wise have been fire and rescue, share of office and social services.
Everything else has been pretty flat.
And so that's just part of where we are.
And I don't think you can make further reductions in those areas where the population has increased 50% since 2000.
So that's the tension we're under.
So far behind.
I didn't mean interrupt.
You're fine.
But the fire and rescue machine, that has an effect on operations.
I think we might have to adjust that, you know, come the fall if we go through a scenario where we take this in this coming year,
the same dollars we have last year, and then decide where to allocate the additional dollars that will come in.
Mr. Chairman, go ahead.
And my comment was going to be that we've been trying really hard to get moving back forward in public safety.
And so that has been our focus.
And we had no choice on social services, you know, the Holy City sent it down on us.
It's better known.
We're responding as best we can.
Other comments?
Well, just a general comment.
To the public and my fellow board members.
My rule of thumb is always Frederick County.
Not Bob Wells and not anybody else in the board or not my friends sitting out there at this IG.
You know, this is what I want you to do.
This will help me out.
If it's best for Frederick County, then that's the thing we should do.
And we're a family.
And our school system and our administrative system here, our county services, our police, our fire.
We're all in this together.
And you keep hearing on TV.
We're together and we can make, make it through this together, but we have to work together.
And I encourage us to do do that.
I encourage all of us to do the best we can to be positive with everybody we come in contact with.
And as we go through our work sessions to do the best we possibly can to reach what's best for Frederick County.
With the funds we have available to do that with.
And look to the future because there will be a future.
I am an optimist.
I do believe there will be a future.
We're completely.
I mean, we're going to get through this.
Yes.
And we need me to try to, again, move forward.
So we, we, we managed to decide on a rate.
Do we need to try to reach a consensus or are, are we okay with seeing what finance comes up with about addressing what comments were made?
I have heard comments that we don't want to add anything to column A.
I want to see what finances analysis renders.
And have it have it out to us.
And then we comment back is what I'd prefer to see as to try to reach a consensus this evening when we don't really have a set of numbers in front of us.
But I'm asking.
So this is Kevin.
Yes.
So I can, I mean, I'd like to see numbers laid out so we can have a chance to just think about it.
I'm not looking to have a budget decided today on X dollars.
I'd like to see what, you know, Mr. Schupper can do on doing that.
I'm sure on it.
And then, you know, I know we can't talk to each other collectively, but at least respond to admin and go from there.
So that was one way to address that.
And then the other comment that I think we will just have to recognize.
And some of those are in the private sector is that there are a lot of people in the private sector.
I mean, red bill alone.
I know four or five families they've been told they will not have a job in two weeks.
You have a husband and wife both fired.
You have another family daughter supporting family.
Gone.
So those in the private sector are taking some big hits.
People that take care of other people know you can't come see me because you might have a virus.
So I think that in the public sector here, if not ideal, but, you know, if there has to be a slight reduction in even salaries from 100% to 99% or 98% to get the additional dollars that we need for elsewhere.
That's for me a reasonable scenario based on what's occurring in the private sector in which you have wholesale shutdowns in some areas.
So I'll just throw that as a comment.
That falls exactly in our discussion about fire and rescue.
I mean, they had three major requests.
We know they need their help.
And we know they're suffering like everyone else is in the current situation.
We can try to see if we can pick one that serves everybody equally.
And maybe we can't get there.
We'll see.
Now, what I would ask is you want a chewing time.
Try to chew quickly.
And no, I'm serious.
Let's move.
We need a resolution.
I just think it should go out with the agenda.
I mean, our community deserves the opportunity to look that over as well.
And this is what gets us numbers.
I'll look at that.
And you'll see the numbers.
And you know, I can come out with multiples same day.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman, your resolution won't be impacted by those details.
I mean, the categories are broad enough where we have what we need for the resolution.
You have already.
That's correct.
Okay.
Yeah.
But we want, yes, sir.
We have two other board members on the line.
I would love to hear your comments.
I think Supervisor Wells is speaking to you too.
Yes.
Hi.
Supervisor Wells.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead, Doug.
Thanks.
Thank you, Supervisor Solar.
I'm in agreement with what the majority has said.
Let's take a look at what the numbers look like under scenario A.
From the beginning of the budget process, I leaned more towards scenario B.
And when I face scenario B, not so much the allocation of the funds,
but just rather than artificially split the revenues between the county side and the school board side,
that we take a look at the whole budget and the priorities and the needs before we take the surplus and allocate it.
So personally, I'd like to still stick to that, but if the consensus is scenario A,
then I can certainly get behind scenario A and look at it.
Thank you for our options, open, knowing that we're going into sort of the unknown at this point.
That's my two cents.
Thank you, sir.
Supervisor Solar.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
The only comment that I would have in regard to that with scenario A,
that would leave $2.7 million that would go to the school,
which is if I recall the, obviously, exact amount in our budget presentation from the school
to open the Jordan Spring Elementary School.
Is that correct?
I think very close.
I think the number was 2.8.
I think that's right.
And so when we talked about this resolution, wasn't really going to change.
That was along as everybody agreed with scenario A.
If I shift to B for some reason, it does change.
So I'm just letting you know.
Yes.
Yes.
All right.
I just want to make sure that they have the resources to open the elementary school,
because that is the highest priority.
Our schools are already overcrowded.
And we have invested a considerable amount of money to build this school.
So it is extremely important that the 2.7 be allocated in my position to the school.
My only comment would be that if we go to scenario B,
the schools are going to get virtually devastated.
Yeah.
I'm in favor of scenario A.
If we are not going to have a tax increase,
if we can manage the positions and so forth and those other priorities,
which would have been covered with a tax increase,
if there's some way to balance that by not allocating salary increases
to our employees and accomplishing the other necessities that our public safety people need.
I think that we have consensus to look at that in contemplate and respond back.
Is that fair?
Yeah.
Okay.
So in your board packet next week,
we'll be the resolution that's based on scenario A.
Okay.
And then you will get information from me on our allocations of what you wanted to be added.
But it doesn't impact the resolution next week.
It's the same.
See, and you're talking about this scenario A.
That scenario A with all the add-ons.
Yes.
With the add, with the add.
Yeah.
And we will try real hard to reach consensus for you and for the rest of staff and for each other
and the community prior to Friday.
Okay.
And so you will see this scenario,
this resolution with this column deleted.
Because this was a tax increase column.
Yes.
Okay.
I think I need, I have one I need.
And we'll work on what you requested tonight.
Okay.
So anything else that we can try to get staff?
That's what we are hoping to accomplish this evening.
Okay.
To me, like the only thing we have left are supervisors comments.
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor, great.
Before we get into that, I have a question from Mr. Tierney.
Please.
Just looking at the resolution or the budget resolutions that you presented tonight.
This is the first that I've gotten to see it.
So forgive me for asking a question here about it.
But at the very end, it says be it for the resolve that the budget for the showing of my sanitary district
we will be appropriated at a later date and is not included in this budget resolution.
Am I understanding this correctly?
We would need to move on that before July 1st.
Is that under this budget?
Yes, you would have to adopt a resolution prior to July 1st for funding.
Okay.
Good enough.
So this resolution would not address them in any way and they could make their decision up.
As written, no, it does not fund them anyway.
Thank you much.
It leaves the rates the same.
It does set the rates because it's on the taxable.
Excellent.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Anyone else?
Supervisor's comments?
Mr. Chairman, I ask for that.
Mr. Roger Graber.
Since I got to give my presentation earlier, I have no further comments.
I just wanted to make sure there was a time allotted to me to give presentation.
So I appreciate the board allowing me the opportunity to do so.
Okay.
Anyone else?
Well, I think that we've made some progress.
I think we had a good discussion.
I want to encourage everyone to continue to do the right thing,
to do in order to be safe and healthy,
to be safe and healthy.
That's the supervisor's well.
I would move to adjourn.
I can second.
All those in favor, aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Opposed.
No, aye.
We will stand adjourn.
Thank you.
Supervisor McCarthy, supervisor, slaughter.
Would love to hear comments on how this worked for you all?
