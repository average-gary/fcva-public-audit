I have 7 p.m. call of meeting to order.
Professor Wells, would you leave some invocation, please sir.
I will, thank you.
Let us pray.
Lord, we ask for your blessing on Frederick County, our country and your world.
18 years ago today on 9-11, we witnessed evil at work.
But we also saw your everlasting love, which reminds us that good, you God, will always triumph
or evil.
Our prayers to all of our first responders, service personnel and those in harm's way.
Our prayers to all those who are suffering with pain and loss.
We ask that you continue to share your love, your guidance and your comfort on each of us.
May God bless each of us, one in all, and may God bless America, amen.
Amen.
Mr. Chairman, I'm off to the leaves of the pledge, please.
We just stand in face of flag and join me in our pledge.
A pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for
which it stands.
One mission under our individual with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you, sir.
The option of the agenda are there any proposed changes?
Not from staff.
Mr. Chairman.
We would like to hand with the agenda.
Motion to approve the agenda as presented.
The approval is presented a second.
Second.
Is there any discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed now.
We'll adopt the agenda as presented.
Cousin agenda, how would the board like to handle that one?
Citizen comments, gentlemen.
Yes, I want to do the consent.
The citizen comments are.
I saw it.
Go ahead.
Brenda Fristone.
I say welcome.
Thank you.
My name is Brenda Fristone.
I'm a citizen of the Stonewall district.
And I want to first thank you, Chairman Haven and board members for serving our community.
We do appreciate your time and effort on our behalf.
I would like to comment on item 12 on tonight's agenda, planning commission business, planning
business 12A request to schedule a joint work session with the planning commission on comprehensive
amendments.
In the reference memorandum, according to my interpretation, director Ruddy cites two purposes
for requesting this joint work session.
Number one is to decide if CPPA number 0209, excuse me, 02-09, Woodside Business Center,
the light property, Lawrence additional consideration and study for ultimate inclusion in the county's
2035 comprehensive plan.
Number two, to receive feedback on what the board would like to see undertaken by the planning
commission over the next several months.
I spoke with director Ruddy this afternoon to clarify this process.
With regard to the additional consideration and study of CPPA number 02-09, I request that
you deny the request to include this in further study.
The CPPC reviewed this application at two different meetings and did not recommend sending
the request forward.
It is my understanding that Carmose is seeking the purchase of this land for future mining
activity.
Ask yourself what is the cost versus the benefit of even entertaining expanding the mining
activity in Frederick County.
If my information is correct, you have a benefit of approximately $200,000.
There is no state personal property taxes, no business license income.
What is the cost, safety of your citizens and children, air and water pollution, sound
pollution, road congestion from heavy duty trucks, a change in the landscape of Stonewall
District from the existing rural setting to a moon landscape where nothing grows and there
are 150 foot tall mountain that keeps expanding in width from green to black gravel.
This one decision on item number 12 will place Carmose one step closer to beginning this
process.
Again, I urge you to deny this request.
If you wish to give feedback to the planning and development department, you may do that
at a later time or bring that up under a different agenda.
Studies and planning sessions can be rescheduled without adding another look at the CPPA number
02-09.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
That's the only one.
Thank you, ma'am.
All right.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Sorry.
I'm missed one.
Is fee schedule?
We approve that.
That's under public works.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So that brings us to a public hearing ordinance to provide implementation of Federal Workforce Innovation Opportunity Act of 2014.
Mr. Mr. Chairman, we need to deal with the Public Works Committee.
I'm sorry.
Do what?
We need to deal with number 9B.
It works committee.
Okay.
That's the one I had.
Yeah.
Okay.
We'll see.
Yeah.
That's what it just asks.
But it was an underfinance.
Sorry.
It wasn't underfinance.
It's under public works.
Right.
So is anyone presenting?
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor McCarthy.
On behalf of the Public Works Committee, I would move for approval of the submitted fee schedule for Fire Prevention Code.
Pardon the motion.
Is there a second?
Second.
And the second.
Is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor Dunn.
I have some concerns on one of the fee schedule per se.
Right now, businesses go and the fire marshal has gone and can inspect with his current capability.
There's about 1,400 companies, businesses in the county.
They've done approximately half of that to 700.
Before we go into a fee schedule, I'd like to see the rest of the county businesses inspected.
See what the issues are.
There have been 10 fires approximately at a 1,400 on a yearly basis.
So I'm not keen on this at the moment and would ask that we delete this.
Okay.
Is there any other discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor McCarthy.
I raised that the Public Works Committee, some concerns.
The first thing I would say is this isn't a vote to empower the fire department to do inspections.
They're currently empowered to do those inspections and they're doing inspections.
In our conversations with the fire department staff, they indicate that they currently have the staff necessary to carry out the code as it's written.
So this doesn't add any additional personnel in order to carry out the inspections.
Also when asked whether or not they had the budget in order to carry out these inspections.
For this year, they indicated that they do some work to Supervisor Dunn.
I'd like to see us move forward this year with expanding those inspections.
If we truly do have the staff to do it.
And then take this up as more of a budget discussion item.
Is it something that we need to look at what the actual cost will be as far as do we need additional manpower in order to carry it out before we sort of submit an arbitrary fee.
Another concern has been brought up by several business owners in my district.
Is that at the lowest end of this fee schedule?
There's a $50 fee for small businesses.
One of this plan, the treasurer's office would be expected to generate sort of a tax bill that would be sent out to those businesses to collect which would eat into that $50 fee.
So the question is, are we really taxing small businesses of $50 fee in order to pay for the treasurer to send them a bill for $50 fee.
So the question is, is it really appropriate at that level to be charging a fee for this?
For us to sort of expand this, use this as a year to sort of see how things go before we implement it a fee schedule.
Mr. Chairman, I think it would be also very worthwhile if we took a year to educate the public as to what is required in the fire inspection process so that it is a good will measure about going into a business and saying if your fire extinguisher needs to be here or you need exit light.
That type of thing that we take this as a measure of an educational process the first year and then evaluate the scheduling fees the second year.
So I don't know if that needs to be a amendment to our motion, but if it does, I would like to offer that further discussion.
Mr. Loft. Mr. Chairman, Mr. President, Mr. Ross and McCarthy pointed out that the Public Works Committee has discussed this several times.
And I believe that we should be committed. The fire prevention code is there for the safety of not only the people working in the building, the people who are visiting the building.
And I think it's just a cost of business that has to be borne by the business that have these inspections done to make sure that the general public and their workers are safe.
And as you pointed out, this puts that expense on the business and not on the taxpayer.
I think Mr. Wells emphasized that fact in the Public Works Committee meeting very well, I think.
Thank you.
Further comments? Supervisor Dyn?
Mr. Loft. Empathetics with your situation, but remember, businesses go and pay taxes.
They pay real estate taxes, they pay gross receipt taxes, they pay machine-ring tools taxes.
So they're already paying taxes. We all want public safety.
But I think that the tax framework is being generated over the course of next year.
We'll allow the fire marshal to go and do his job without imposing additional fees at this time.
Mr. Chairman.
I would just reiterate that it was the fire department that said they have the money, the facilities, the time and manpower in order to get the inspections done.
They're currently empowered to do it, so I'm not opposed to having a fee schedule in place.
But like Supervisor Slotter had mentioned, I think it would be wise before we sort of start sending out tax bills to residents for an inspection that they weren't necessarily expecting that we take a year to start to expand the project, educate the public.
Like, find out what the real cost of the project is as we expand it before we determine what that fee schedule should be and implement it.
So I'm not opposed to having a fee schedule at some point, but at this point, if we don't have, if we have the manpower and we have the facility to get it done, then I think we should use our resources this year to get those inspections done.
So this isn't a matter of implementing a safety measure. The safety measures are already been implemented.
Whether or not to pay into a system to cover that, and my understanding is we already have the funds and the manpower to do it.
So to take one year to ease our way into this, it's not like these inspections aren't going to happen. They're empowered to do it. They're going to happen. They're already happening.
So I don't want there to be some obfuscation as to what this goes about. This isn't about whether or not we support fire, if we all do.
And we're already doing that. This is about do we charge an extra fee on top of the inspections that are already being done?
I agree. This is the right thing to do. We will monitor it in the necessary as we have to all these types of things.
I just think of the best way also to help them understand is to have the person there at their business.
This is by far the right approach.
So really helps that we do these kinds of things in insurance premiums. Is there any further discussion?
Motion is to forward for a proof. Supervisor McCarthy.
No.
Professor Slotter. No.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye.
Yes.
Supervisor Loft.
Aye.
Supervisor Dunn.
No.
Supervisor Trial.
Aye.
Supervisor Votes. Aye. Motion carries. And we will move forward.
Thank you.
All right. Next is public hearing ordinance implementing federal workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2014.
I've got that one, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you. This is sort of a housekeeping exercise for the board.
I invite you being asked to consider an ordinance to provide for the implementation of the federal workforce innovation and opportunity act of 2014.
And authorizing Frederick County's participation in the Shandoah Valley elected officials consortium under the auspices of the Shandoah Valley workforce development board.
The board has previously adopted versions of this agreement in 2006, 2012 and 2015.
It's before you tonight because following a recent administrative audit of the agreement.
Several technical areas were identified, which the old and existing agreement were deficient in.
For example, specific, specific clauses that the workforce innovation and opportunity act required to be in the agreement were omitted.
Because this is a joint exercise of powers type agreement.
It should be enacted by ordinance.
What most localities have done is either approved it under consent or a motion of just regular motion and second in absence of a public hearing.
So the auditors require the Shandoah Valley workforce development board to revise the agreement.
And they retain legal counsel to complete those revisions.
This is a federally funded program and Paige County serves as a fiscal agent for the program.
I would note in the agreement itself that as a condition of the federal grant, the localities are financially responsible in the event the local workforce development board where to misuse funds received under this grant.
And in the event that any misuse were to occur, each participating locality would be responsible on a program basis for the amount each locality benefited from the grants program assistance.
But I would point out that the agreement requires the consortium to ensure that the workforce development board purchase insurance to cover any misuse of grant funds, which provides some protection to the localities.
And the Shandoah Valley workforce development board does hold insurance coverage in excess of the amount of funding they receive as a way to alleviate liability concerns of the participating localities.
In the staff memo in your agenda packet, we sort of briefly outlined what benefits the workforce development board have provided to Frederick County since June 30th of 2019.
It's actually $17,000 has been contributed to Frederick County companies through the Valley to Virginia registered apprenticeship initiative.
And they are working with 25 apprentices at five different companies. Approximately 4,270 individuals have gone through the Winchester Virginia Career Work Center for employment services and support.
And so because this agreement needs to be enacted by ordinance, the public hearing has been scheduled for tonight.
And at the conclusion of the public hearing staff is seeking board action on this proposed ordinance.
And I would point out that Ms. Joan Holland with the Shandoah Valley workforce development board is present tonight if the board has any specific questions relative to that organization.
All right, sir. Thank you.
Questions of Mr. Tips.
Anyone?
All right, this is a public hearing. Would anyone like to comment concerning this proposed ordinance adoption? Anyone at all?
Anyone?
Seeing no one will close the public hearing portion. The board like to handle this one.
Mr. Chairman.
I would move that we adopt the ordinance approval as presented tonight and that we move forward.
Second.
Motion in a second. Is there any discussion?
It's Professor McCarthy.
No.
Supervisor Slotter.
No.
Supervisor Wells.
All right.
Supervisor Lofton.
All right.
Supervisor Dunn.
Aye.
I'm sorry.
Aye.
Thank you. Supervisor Trout.
Aye.
Chair votes aye. Motion carries.
Ordinance is adopted.
I'll bring us to planning commission business public hearing conditional use permit 06-19 landfall lodge.
Yes. Good evening, Mr. Chairman. Members of the board of supervisors.
This is a conditional use permit for a special event facility.
The property is located at 350 Chestnut Grove Road in Winchester.
And the property is identified with property identification numbers 30-A-50 and 30-A-50D in the
Gainesboro Magisterial District.
The property is presently zoned RA, which is our rural area zoning district.
The current land use is residential and agricultural.
The total acreage being 188 acres of which 150 acres is in a conservation event.
The proposed use is a special event facility for weddings, charity, and other similar type events.
Directing your attention to the screen, the subject properties are outlined in blue.
The applicant resides on the premise in an existing single family detached home.
They plan to access the property only from Chestnut Grove Road for special event traffic, where the traffic will go around the existing residents.
Downhill to the rear of the property, which includes several outbuildings, one of which is an enclosed barn that's used for the weddings.
Includes catering kitchen, restrooms, dance floor, and a bridal suite that can be used for getting ready by guests.
They also use the outside of the property for various charity events, including fishing and outdoor weddings.
There is a second entrance to the property, which is shared access driveway, that is restricted to private use, agricultural use, and use by the owners.
It's not open for special event traffic.
Should the Board of Supervisors find this used to be appropriate, the Planning Commission has recommended the following conditions.
These are all review agency comments that will be complied with at all times, that an illustrative sketch plan be submitted to and approved by Federal County prior to the establishment of the use.
The building permits would be required for any new buildings or structures associated with the special event facility.
But special events would start no earlier than 8 a.m. and all events and related activities would conclude by midnight that special events may accommodate up to and not to exceed 250 persons that only the main entrance associated with the address, 350 Chestnut Grove Road shall be open for special event traffic, and that all other entrances to the property should be gated for private residential and agricultural traffic only.
They would also be allowed one monument style sign with a sign area not to exceed 50 square feet and 10 feet in height that any expansion or modification of this use in the future would require the approval of a new conditional use permit.
The Planning Commission recommended approval of this conditional use permit at their August 7th meeting, and following a public hearing this evening, staff seeking a decision from the Board of Supervisors on this CUP for a special event facility.
Staff is happy to answer any questions you may have in the applicant, Mr. Low Henderson representing the landfall lodge is here this evening as well. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Questions of Mr. Klein, anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
I don't have a question specifically for Mr. Klein, but if Mr. or if this is the appropriate time, I do have one question for Mr. Klein.
I have a question for Mr. Henderson if this is the appropriate time.
Okay, we'll go. Anyone from Mr. Klein?
Thank you. Welcome, Mr. Henderson. Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Henderson. As part of this application, do you have any intention of building additional facilities on the property for the event center purposes?
No, not for the wedding event facility.
We want to keep it small and the infrastructure is there. I might run out of room to store hay, so I might have to put another barn for hay storage, but as far as the event center now.
And would you have any objection if this application of this vote was amended to say that any building built for the event center would require you to come back before this board to get approval under the CUP?
Oh, no problem at all.
I appreciate that. Thank you.
Other questions, anyone? Is there anything you'd like to add, sir?
No, sir, out of respect for time. Everything's pretty well laid out. Hopefully you have the support letters from the numerous individuals and appreciate your time.
Appreciate what you all do for the county and your consideration of our CUP.
Thank you, sir.
This is a public hearing. What do you want to like to comment concerning this proposed conditional use permit? Anyone at all? Yes, ma'am.
We could have your name, Magisterial District and Limitra comments to three minister or less, please.
My name is Jamie Marion and the district. I'm not 100% certain.
So I apologize. Chairman and members of the board. Good evening. My name is Jamie Marion and just like last month at the Planning Commission meeting.
I was here to speak on behalf of my parents Lee and Betty Marion, the property owners since 2006 to 236 Chestnut Grove Road.
My father has a terminal illness and he's unable to be here this evening. So I feel very confidently speaking to you this evening as the executor of the estate and as their power of attorney.
From last month's meeting until now, I've had the opportunity to go back and watch the footage from the meeting and truly listen to what was stated by everyone regarding the conditional use permit for landfall lodge.
My brother and I along with our parents have discussed this matter several several times and the three and there are a few things that I would like to revisit this evening as you prepared to make your final decision regarding the fate of this business, which ultimately impacts the surrounding neighbors.
Mr. Klein showed the Planning Commission a map at last month's meeting depicting the residential driveway to the property owners.
Anyone could clearly see the size of the property, which I believe both Mr. Klein and Mr. Henderson stated was 188 acres. Clearly it has sustainable space and or acreage to develop a wider primary access road, which ultimately would sustain more traffic.
I would like to think that a profitable company and what appears to be a reputable venue would take a portion of the proceeds earned to further develop their business and their property.
By doing so, I would also like to think that excavation and widening of the primary access road would be a considerable project to sustain their growth versus the burden of using our road, which includes agricultural needs.
If the primary road of their property is not good enough for access and I would have to say I'm sorry, but this problem cannot become our problem as well.
There appears to be a tremendous investment in the property to allow this business. So again, I would think that investing more of their money and bringing their primary access road up to standards would be a considerable option instead of trying to take the easy route and burdening us our property and our road for their benefit.
Speaking of finances and while their finances are none of our concern, I can't help but feel confused and conflicted when Mr. Henderson stated to the Planning Commission and I quote, while it hasn't been a financial burden on my wife and I, one of our concerns and our goals and priority is for their four children, grandchildren and future generations to receive income to offset the cost to maintain the property.
Further on, Mr. Henderson stated in a quote again, it was $16,000 to $18,000 cost to place the farm in the conservation easement, but producing hay, cutting firewood, timber and boarding horses might bring in enough revenue to pay for taxes and insurance, but is not enough to pay for the upkeep of all the buildings and the roads.
Finally, in quoting one last time regarding the finances, in 2016 they were asked to rent their barn, costs were going up, it was a great opportunity to offset the costs.
Is that much time?
Going completely.
So again, their finances are not our concern, but it can be concluded when reading between the lines at events, weddings, et cetera are in fact needed to maintain and sustain this property.
With that, they disclose that they have a selective clientele in which each applicant goes through a rigorous application process and if they don't meet their guidelines, they don't rent to them, a hardly doubt.
A growing business and a business of the size would turn away paying individuals or any charitable event that would positively promote their business.
So what is our goal as a neighbor?
What would we like to see happen?
We have two objectives in mind and we are hoping the board will take the following into consideration.
First, would the board please consider as an additional condition for approval that all traffic non-related to schedule event on the day, i.e., renter, farming and any other traffic be required to access the property via 350 Chestnut Grove Road so that the gate maintains to be locked at all times.
Otherwise, it will always be an excuse if the gate is left unlocked with no recourse other than continued excuses.
By requiring this as an additional condition for approval, you will always know when they are in violation.
It would be more clear and evident instead of always fighting excuses and empty promises that it will be fixed next time.
Second, there is a lot of event traffic that accesses the road generally a few days or even a week before scheduled event.
We are again asking to please make it a condition for approval that any event party traffic regardless of access timeframes must access through 350 Chestnut Grove Road.
Third, would the board please make an additional condition for approval that all commercial and heavy equipment regardless if it's for residential or commercial purposes must enter and access via 350 Chestnut Grove Road.
The use of dump trucks, tractors, trailers and other heavy equipment is damaging our property for their commercial use and benefit.
Just to give you an example, one dump truck can haul 17 tons of gravel.
There were 10 dump trucks at one time, a one particular day delivering gravel in which our road took a hit.
V. Finally installed a culvert on our road and it's only a matter of time before that cracks or collapses than what?
I believe it's only-
You need to conclude.
I'll give you an opportunity after others if had an opportunity if you'd like to come back and finish.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Would anyone else like to comment?
Good evening, Mr. Chairman and board members of the board.
My name is Corey Hammons and I own the property known as Black Smoke Farm located at 240 Chestnut Grove Road.
The entire north portion of my property borders the south portion of landfall farm.
The lodge sits less than 400 feet from where I plan to build my house and will be directly above it.
As my property is located significantly closer to the lodge other than other adjoining properties that anyone would have a concern and be me.
I do not.
There are numerous reasons why but the primary one is the farm is in the conservation easement.
I know that the view from my back deck of my future house will never change.
That as long as I live there I'll never have to worry about a developer putting in dozens of homes that will remain pristine.
Now for the past year and a half I've rented the cottage on the farm so I'm aware of the activities held at the lodge.
I try to volunteer as many of the charity events as there are a great opportunity to meet some wonderful people and to support a great cause.
As I see it any preceded inconvenience for a dozen or so days out of the years a small piece of pay for the incredible peace and certainty I enjoy the remaining 340 to 350 days.
In addition low and audio have been wonderful landlords and I know will be fantastic neighbors.
I can't think of a better place in Frederick Island to live and raise a family and I'm extremely fortunate.
Having shared my story I hope you guys will approve their conditional use permit.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you sir.
Anyone else like to comment anyone.
Yes ma'am.
Good evening Mr. Chairman and Board of Directors.
I am Betty Marion.
I am the resident that lives on 236th.
Chestnut Grove Road.
Areas where I want to retouch on the last meeting of August 7th.
There you go.
Good job.
Well done.
Thank you.
It doesn't pay to be short.
But anyway I want to make sure that all traffic for the landfall lodge goes through 350 entrants.
Even prior days to the event gates to be locked for landfall lodge for delivery of all equipment for the event truck grills anything used for the event.
Gate remains locked for access during the time of the event and for the house also rented down there.
If 350 road is not up to par for the traffic that they're receiving that it needs to be so.
You know you shouldn't have reflected on your neighbors.
He stated that he had notified the neighbors of events happening.
I have one letter here that was stated back in April 11th 2013 that he had notified that's the only letter ever gotten.
That he was having an event down there which was on Memorial Day weekend and he expected 300 people to be down there.
That's a lot of people coming down our road.
I mean I clearly agree it's an easy access from my house straight down there versus them going around the curve and going in the 350 exit.
But you know it just I just don't think it's fair.
Also I want to show you some pictures also of the road that you all can see and also the heavy equipment just recently.
This truck here weigh in 1700 tons came through there the other day to go down to put gravel on landfall lodge because I even talked to the driver and he told me that he was going down there to deliver gravel.
And 17 times is a lot to come across that little culvert the dot put in our driveway and didn't charge anything.
The culvert needed to be put in because of the water back up from residents across the street.
Again my husband is disabled.
The road needs to be at access all the time for emergency medical teams to access us.
But clearly I think that it needs to be everything goes through 350 entrance for all the activities down there.
If I could approach the bench to show you this letter.
I'll give those with Mr. Tibb's he'll pass them down for you and you can collect them there at the end of the meeting.
That's basically all I have to say and I think my daughter and my son has done a wonderful job of being so concerned about this property.
We moved there in 2006 and lived there ever since and we thought we were moving to a rural area that we wouldn't have this.
And I loved my home and I would hate to force to be solid just because I cannot stand this.
So with further ado I guess that's all I have to say.
Thank you.
But I do think that the gate needs to be locked at all times.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Anyone else like to comment concerning this proposed CUP?
Anyone?
Yes sir?
Not yet sir.
Anyone else?
Anyone at all?
If you'd like to finish your comments you're welcome to come forward and do that.
Please try to limit them to three minutes.
From where I left off the above considerations would eliminate our concerns at any given point the need for emergency personnel vehicles to access our road and with our ailing father or any other individual needing medical assistance.
Mr. Henderson and two others alluded to how much this business contributes to the community families and the youth whether it be in the form of scholarships or as Mr. Henderson pointed out the benefits of a single mother giving her children the opportunity to fish at zero cost to them.
Their charitable works or NW works in the Evans home.
My family and I think what they do are doing is great.
It's wonderful.
Don't get us wrong.
Please.
In fact it's commendable what they are doing to better the lives of those in our community.
But their challenges of having this business cannot become our problem nor should it interfere with our property for their benefit.
In conclusion I would like to reiterate that prior to this business becoming successful in thriving we never had any issues on our old country road that is one single lane.
For 13 years my parents have loved and enjoyed and invested into their property and until the last couple years they have loathed the events at landfall lodge hosts as it interrupts their lives living conditions and their level of comfort and wellbeing.
The road has been a significant stressor for us and we are hoping that you will consider our proposed conditions before final approval is given.
I am thankful for your time and once again thank you for listening to my concerns.
Thank you.
Anyone else? Mr. Anderson?
Yes, thank you.
The viewing public can't hear you.
Okay, sorry about that.
Also adjust that for me please.
Okay.
To get really physical where to push it on up there.
There you go.
Just to clarify on the gate scenario as Corey mentioned we do have a rental house that's been a rental house there for decades upon decades and the gate is right the edge of the property.
I will close it during events if necessary but traffic for the event won't even make it to the gate that goes by the Marion's property because it will be blocked off probably about 50 yards prior to even going to that access road.
And as far as I also have my renters that need to come and go.
Now as far as that letter I had stated going back to August 13th I mean April 13th that was prior to the first Hunter Crane Memorial event.
We in fact had close to 450 people attend that memorial and tribute to Hunter Crane.
We parked everybody up top but is trying to be good neighbor.
I advised all my neighbors that we were having this event.
We had people checking in and we only had approximately a dozen cars come in that way.
All the traffic came in through the 350 chestnut grove row.
So I just wanted to make clarification on those two points.
Thank you sir.
Come here.
No question.
Okay.
That's the answer.
This time right.
Thank you sir.
Thank you.
Anyone else like to comment concerning this proposed CUP?
Anyone?
Anyone at all?
And we'll close the public hearing.
Would you like to ask a question?
No, let's go.
No, let's go ahead.
I can clarify as we go on.
Okay.
All right.
How would the board this is Gainesboro?
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor McCart.
I'd like to move for approval of the application with one additional condition which would be that no additional new building structures be built without re-application for a new conditional use permit.
All right.
You've heard the motion is our second.
Second.
And the second.
Is there any discussion?
Anyone?
I don't know if I could mention McCarthy.
The route, the 350.
I didn't get a chance to see that.
And that's what I was going to ask.
But I'm sure you're familiar with that.
Is that the primary road that is the road that will be used?
Am I correct with that?
Yes.
That's my understanding.
Is that right?
Yes, yes.
That is correct.
Okay.
All right.
Further discussion, anyone?
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Slotter.
Hi.
Supervisor Wells.
Hi.
Supervisor Lockton.
Hi.
Supervisor Dunn.
Hi.
Supervisor Trout.
Hi.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
The CUP is approved with additional condition.
All right.
That'll bring us to a public hearing.
Reasoning zero to one nine of CP ventures.
Ms. Perkins.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.
This is a request to rezone 1.04 acres from the B-2 business general district to the B-3 industrial transition district with proffers.
Now, subject property is located on the south side of Route 11 and north east side of Amaco lane.
And if I can direct you to the screen on your left for reference purposes, you have Martinsburg Pike Route 11.
Amaco lane, then Interstate 81, and the subject property is outlined in pink on this map.
Now, the subject property was part of a rezoning that was approved back in 2016, which rezoned a split zone piece of property B-2-B-3 to the B-2 district with proffers.
And the piece that we're talking about tonight is that front corner, which is the 1.04 acres, which is now partial 48 E.
So, the primary change that they are requesting is the zoning change from the B-2 to the B-3.
But the applicant also proposes two proper revisions other than the zoning.
First is to remove the metal building prohibition that was originally proposed, and they're also removing the SCADA system proper.
Both of those proffers will still pertain to the remainder of the property that was rezoned back in 2016.
So, the Planning Commission recommended approval of this rezoning at their August 7th meeting, and tonight following the public hearings, staff is seeking a decision from the board on this request.
I would be glad to answer any questions, and Mr. Evan White with Greenway Engineering is here on behalf of the application.
Thank you. Questions from Ms. Perkins, anyone?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. White, anything you'd like to answer?
Welcome.
Thank you, Mr. Chair and members of the board. I'm Evan White with Greenway Engineering.
Just to give a little context for the request this evening, as Candice said in 2016, as you all know, we resend the property to B-2.
The property owner has had an opportunity to work with a prospective purchaser that will be doing an automotive, battery, and tire service facility, and staff identified that through your SIC code is required in B-3 zoning, which is the reason we're here.
So, the members that were provided in 2016, if you're familiar with the site, some of them have been already implemented, some of them are ongoing.
And then another change that's occurred since the original rezoning that was approved was that working with Frederick Water, we were able to move away from a pump station situation to a gravity sewer line, which obviously is beneficial to both Frederick Water and the applicants that's been installed.
So, the basis of the metal building proffer removal, I will read it to you how it was written in 2016, and it says the owner hereby proffers to prohibit metal building construction on the property.
So, the prospect that the owner is working with in this particular application had questioned what that actually meant, how it would be defined and interpreted.
And the reason is because the building that they're doing, like most commercial buildings, is the block and type construction, but there might be some metal components to it, whether it's a roof system, or it might be an architectural feature or a bed door, and they did not want that to be problematic.
So, the owner asked us to drop that from the proffer.
That issue was raised by Supervisor McCann slaughter, and we talked about it, and we think that it would be appropriate to reinsert that proffer into the action that you're considering tonight, but with rewarding, and if I may, we would like to have it say, the owner hereby proffers to prohibit the construction metal buildings on the property.
The building shall be permitted to have metal roofs, metal architectural, and ornamental features, and accents, and metal bed doors.
So, in essence, you're not, you're still really not the potential of like a standard type butter building, but if there's an architectural system, or something that is kind of more modern, so to speak, that that doesn't preclude that.
If it pleases the board, we would be willing to add that in as proffer A2 under the land use restrictions, and I'll be happy to answer any questions the boards might have.
Questions?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I appreciate the attempt to reinsert the prohibition on the metal buildings, the term architectural feature, though, could be just as anomalous as the term of metal building.
Would something to the effect of, but that the building shall not be substantially clad in metal, would that be acceptable to your client?
Yeah, the idea, however we get there, because we hopefully need to get there this evening, is to go ahead and commit to what most of us would perceive when we think of a metal building,
but trying not to get into the minutiae of a definition that seven different people might have a different idea.
So we thought it was safest to include metal roofs, architecture and ornamental features, and accents, and bay doors, particularly for this case, bay doors is important.
But if there's a better way to say that, we're certainly interested.
Yeah, I'd like what you propose with the addition of not substantially clad, because if we just leave it as an architectural element, I think that opens up to the question as an entirely metal clad building, is that an architectural element for that building?
So I think as long as we can clarify that, I would appreciate that effect.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Other questions and Mr. Wyatt, anyone?
All right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So is the public hearing, would anyone like to comment concerning this proposed rezoning?
Anyone?
Anyone at all?
Seeing no one, we'll close the public hearing portion of the meeting.
It's a stone wall.
Yes, sir, Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a motion to approve rezoning 02-19 for CB Ventures LLC, with the updated language regarding the metal building, and also the language that Supervisor McCarthy offered to address the cladding of the building.
All right.
Second.
Second.
Second.
Is there any discussion?
Anyone?
Supervisor Trump?
Aye.
Supervisor Dunn?
Aye.
Supervisor Lofton?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells?
Aye.
Supervisor Schlager?
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy?
Chair votes aye.
The motion carries.
And the rezoning is approved.
All right.
Mr. Chairman, would you like to bring us to request a schedule or work session?
Mr. Chairman, if I may be very brief and recognize that the request is to schedule a work session with the Planning Commission and Comprehensive Plans and Programs Committee to discuss this year's one application for a CPPA amendment, which is the Woodside Business Center.
I would like to propose the date, which would be preferable, hopefully, before the next Board of Supervisors meeting, which is on September 25th, or to another date that the Board may find more favorable.
But in suggesting that date, that is when we would ideally like to participate in that work session with the Board of Supervisors and discuss the CPPA amendment that is in front of us in this annual process.
So you're proposing the 25th?
Yes, sir.
That would be immediately before the Board meeting.
Potentially at 6 p.m.
Prior to.
Go ahead. Supervisor Locke.
I'd say the question, Mr. Ruddy.
Do you believe that an hour is going to be adequate to go over the points you have to make in discussion?
25th suits me.
I just wonder if that hour of time frame is going to be adequate.
As you can see what was suggested, obviously, we have a CPPA amendment to deal with.
In addition, it is a good opportunity, always, if the Planning Commission Board of Supervisors would like to discuss any of the items that may be out there.
And of course, the memo suggests some that may be worthy of discussion, but we're, of course, looking to the Board to see if there's anything of interest to the Board.
We felt an hour would be appropriate, but we would be certainly willing and able to go longer than that if the Board desired.
Mr. Chair.
I would just recommend an extra 30 minutes, maybe 5.30.
That gives us time, a break between this discussion and a regular Board meeting.
Mr. Chairman.
I agree with that. I think that's a good idea.
Mr. Chairman.
We're planning on having a closed session on September the 25th, which would be a conflict.
We don't know yet, but we would still have time.
I'm just saying we may want to schedule these days.
Oh, my schedule is horrific, so.
Well, I'm asking because we haven't already started.
I will not be there September 25th, regardless.
So it's irrelevant.
Thank you.
All right, Mr. Chairman.
Other senior brothers are done.
Instead of being the 25th, a week from now, was your alternative, Mr. Ruddy.
And like Mr. Lofton said, I feel constrained on an hour time.
So it's possible to have it an hour and a half prior to that next Wednesday meeting.
You know, start at 5 or start at 4.30.
It keeps us a chance because you have a number of items here, an updated northeast plan, access roads, etc.
So there's a number of items here that we're going to have an in-depth conversation.
I don't think you're going to get it done in such a short time.
Are you suggesting September 18th, as in next week?
Yes.
Yes, ma'am.
Again, depending on the board's future schedule, too.
We could also look a little farther out if that's appropriate.
I do know that the Planning Commission has a regularly scheduled meeting,
at which they have available time.
However, I also know that there's a meeting with the Shenavelli electric company a little earlier
that evening, which may present a conflict to some.
So there may well be another date that we could look at in the future with the board of supervisors.
All right.
So we're talking about this work session.
A question about staff.
We do have the annual opportunity, so I'm going to take an advantage of that.
So we do need to get an answer.
What's the board's pleasure?
530 on the 25th.
Mr. Chairman, I'll make a recommendation for 530 on the September 25th.
210.
530.
On September 25th.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
It's a possibility to include supervisor trout.
I mean, if she's a conflict, then I'll look for a date that's going to be here at all.
So it's going to be here with the board meeting here.
Right.
But do you want to find another time which you can?
Yes.
Okay, with everyone else.
But.
Have a motion.
Did we get a second?
No.
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Now we have a second.
Here you go.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, supervisor trout.
I'm sorry.
No, I was just saying.
I can't be there.
September 25th.
So if you would like to schedule it then, that's fine with me.
I just won't attend.
Okay.
What's the pleasure of the board?
We have a motion.
Further discussion.
If we're going to do it on the 25th, I'd like to do it like, you know, five o'clock.
If there's no further discussion, supervise McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor slaughter.
Hi.
Supervisor Wells.
Hi.
Supervisor Loft.
Hi.
Supervisor Dunn.
Hi.
Supervisor trout.
Hi.
Thank you.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
We will meet on the 25th for your work session at 530.
Thanks.
And if need be, we can reschedule additional if you need to.
Very well.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Port liaison reports are there any?
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Wells.
The Parks and Recreation Committee met this week.
And has been announced there's some new ball fields being built and new complex.
And Parks and Recreation Department is seeking public input for names and
suggestions for these new ball parks.
They're located on Stevenson Road and Stevenson, Virginia.
They're going to replace the current ball fields located at Clearbrook.
So comments and suggestions are welcome.
And they're encouraging folks to get online on Parks and Recreation, make comments, suggest
names and so forth.
So please get involved and take your opportunity to name the ball fields.
Thank you very much.
Actually, name the park.
Name the park, excuse me.
Thank you.
I should be.
Yes.
We're looking for the community's health partner name.
Name the names.
Our new park.
New park, I'm sorry.
You're exactly right.
Well, thank you, Doc.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Supervisor Law.
Mr. Chairman.
At the source of service is board meeting Tuesday.
The director came to green, share some information with us that I thought was worth passing
on.
As you know, they do a human's job.
And the state actually grades them on a number of items and which they're supposed to perform.
And one item that is particularly stuck out of my mind that I would like to thank the
social service department, the staff, you do a great job.
And that is the number of cases, ongoing cases error rate was 0% for Frederick County this
last quarter.
So kudos to the social service department and all that staff for the great job that they continue
to do.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
That's phenomenal.
It's almost impossible to do.
Well done.
Anyone else?
The A's on reports?
Anyone?
All right.
All right.
That'll bring us to the portion of our meeting for citizen comments regarding any topic of local
interest.
If you would, if you'd come to the podium, give us your name, Magistero District, and limit your
comments to three minutes or less, please.
Anyone like to bring comments to the board?
Mr. Stath.
Hello.
It's me again.
Thank you.
Thank you so much for this opportunity to speak.
Just a little bit.
Thank you.
Again, I'm Brenda Fristo, and I live on Bruce Town Road in Stonewall District.
I would like to ask that the board consider using a window of opportunity opened by a potential
disaster to place added restrictions on the buffer distance for the property, the ball
fields that will be returned to Carmous Lyman Stone when the lease is up in November.
According to the application with the Virginia Department of Mining, the buffer will be 25 feet
from the mining activity beside the park.
I propose that given the recent developments of the county impose a stricter buffer area beside
Clearbrook Park that would increase this to 725 feet.
On September 3, projectile fragment rocks from a failed blasting operation at the Carmous
site across from Stonewall Elementary School, reach the school and adjacent properties.
The star noted that these rock fragments traveled 700 feet, while Carmous is under the direct
authority of the Virginia Department of Mining, the safety and well-being of the children
and adults in this county are under your authority.
In mid-July, Art Bragg, my husband and myself, reached out to Carmous and met with Mr. Thompson,
the plant manager and Mr. McCotch, the area operations manager with 13 items of concern.
A copy of this list was emailed to many of you.
Item number five on that July meeting list, red, changed the blasting schedule to either
before 8 a.m. in the morning or after 4 p.m. Monday through Friday to protect the children.
I noted that the road is closed, Route 11, however the children are still on the playground
when they blast every day Monday through Friday.
The written Carmous response, and I quote, no to changing the blasting schedule, our schedule
is limited to daylight hours and we will work in direct communications with the closest
neighbors and the school.
Was the board aware that Clearbrook Park is on a lockdown five days a week when Carmous
blast?
Yes, I mean lockdown.
No one goes into the park and no one can come out.
I have seen the dust cloud from the blasting at the current location and many cases which
leaves zero visibility to park attendees.
What is going to happen when mining begins on the ball field area?
I understand a 25 foot buffer is proposed.
Clearly this is not acceptable.
I proposed the county impose a 725 foot buffer area given the latest blasting accident.
I've been working with Mr. Bibb and Mr. Hutchison of the Virginia Department of Minerals and
Mining Representatives for over a year.
May I, I'm almost, thank you, trying to hold Carmous accountable to the governing regulations.
We have a meeting with Senator Jill Vogel on November 14th to request that she introduce
legislation that prevents another jurisdiction from having to endure the reckless disregard
to a community by building 150 foot high and several football field wide debris mountain
to ruin the landscape of the district.
I end with a direct quote from Mr. Ian Cacara of Carmous to me quote, there is no incentive
for us to change the entrance, the exit, add air monitors, get rid of the debris pile or
change blasting schedules, end quote, maybe not, but there is much incentive for this board
to extend the buffer to at least 725 feet.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Anyone else have anything at all they'd like to share with the board?
Anyone?
Yes, ma'am.
Good evening.
I'm Victoria Kidd and I live in Pembridge Heights in Shannon Trouts district.
I am appreciative of this opportunity to speak.
I have owned a business in the county for 10 years.
I've lived in the county for about 12, 13 years before opening my business light away
cafe downtown.
I'm very proud to live here.
I'm proud to be a Virginia and I am very proud to participate in a number of community
and civic organizations that do a lot of good in and around the county including the Winchester
Pride Committee which leads me to the reason that I wanted to make a statement tonight
on their behalf.
Not on your agenda tonight obviously is the nondiscrimination policy but there are
good many people here behind me that are here in response to that.
First I want to applaud the Human Resources Committee for working to keep the area moving
forward and to suggest policies that attract and retain talent and are in line with what
has repeatedly been recognized with the best practices of municipalities across the
country as well as for commercial purposes which is a directly in my wheelhouse obviously.
Over 80% of the nation's commercial businesses have adopted such policies so certainly there
is an awful lot of data and information to support that it is indeed the best practices.
But on a more personal level I am here to speak to you tonight because as a individual
I have personally been fired from a job before for being a member of the LGBT community
and I can tell you that that is not something that I ever want anyone else to experience it
is very personable it is very hurtful and it is thankfully unnecessary because as you
know there are other municipalities in the state that have these protections even the
state government themselves have a similar nondiscrimination policy that actually goes
even further than this one did.
So I would encourage the Human Resources Committee as well as the Board to speak with and
look into those policies at Alexandria, Arlington for example to see how they have implemented
those practices to protect their existing talent and to retain that talent and to attract
additional talent because LGBTQ people have an awful lot to offer this community diversity
is important their abilities should be valued and we believe that an nondiscrimination
policy is the best way to do that.
We hope that the Board will continue to work on this issue that the most recent decision
is not the conclusion of the issue and we believe that policies can be enacted to make
this a very vibrant and diversified and respectful community that ensures that persons such
as myself that have a lot to offer continue to be proud to live here and in conclusion
I just want to say I appreciate the work that you do and that we as the Winchester Pride
Committee are willing and interested in helping with this issue in any way that we can thank
you.
Thank you.
Yes sir.
You have to go way up with the microphone sir.
I love this game don't you.
Thank you.
All right.
Well thank you for pointing me out Chairman.
My name is William Wright.
I am from the Frederick County just I forget which district.
I am also a bisexual male I am a member of the newly formed we matter Winchester support
group is an LBGTQ who support group and I would also like to comment on the same policies
that it just been rescinded.
I would first like to think also I'd like sorry I would like to mention the most of the
information I got was from the Winchester star the article was written about it so thank
you.
First I would like to thank Representative Chen and Trial for trying to keep the protections
in place because no one should have to fear losing a government job because they are
active military or they may be having a child or if they are a member of the LBGTQ community.
Protection protections related to a person sexual orientation or gender identity or what
are what were mentioned as a signing for the reason to remove the new policy because it
violates a law that says the state government that the local government would be overstepping
its bounds within the state government.
Even though Alexandria and Arlington County have both been successfully passed protections
like the one that has just been pulled because most likely they like many others have learned
that it shouldn't matter if a teacher is transgender or if a secretary is gay or even
if a board supervisor was both.
It matters if they can do what is needed for their position.
President LaRocque has represented in our state has mentioned that he believes we shouldn't
provide special rights or protections for anyone so chosen sexual habits.
Maybe my sexual is not a choice.
It is what I am and if I was working for the Frederick County government in any way it
would not be relevant to how well I could do my job.
These are not special rights.
These are the rights that any employee deserves under any job.
I agree.
We need to hire those that can do the best for the community but being LGBTQ has nothing
to do with that and should never be used as a reason to remove them from that job and
I ask that you consider placing those protections back on.
Thank you.
Any questions?
I would be one to answer.
That we can't do but thank you sir.
Appreciate your comment.
We can't do questions.
All right.
Thank you.
Is there anyone else who would like to comment?
Yes, ma'am.
I hope that's good enough.
Good.
Thanks.
Good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.
My name is Diana D. Cleveland and I am also a member of the Winchester Celebration Pride
event that we had.
This was our second year to have this year and we all think it went really well.
There was no trouble and it was just a great event.
So I want to thank you all for taking it and letting me have the opportunity to speak.
So with all due respect, I just have one question.
Why are we as residents of the Frederick County and I am of the Redbud District?
Why are we falling behind in a progressive movement to protect all individuals equally
from discrimination?
It would be nice one day soon that we are all able to be equal with one another.
And that's all I have to say.
So it's less than three minutes.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Yes, ma'am.
Hi.
My name is Reverend Mary Bullock, I'm the pastor of Shenandoah Valley Metropolitan Community
Church here in Winchester.
I've been a resident of the Shawnee District for a year now.
It is a wonderful and welcoming place in Winchester and I am very pleased to be a new part
of this community.
However, I have gotten a lot of feedback from other clergy colleagues, other LGBTQ advocate
colleagues that have said, why is your small rural county in Virginia making national
news?
I hate to tell you this, but I think we've done more damage by extending and rescinding
a protection than by ever having offered it at all.
I want to strongly encourage you and fervently pray that you will reconsider your rescinding
that you will evaluate how we can protect all of our constituents and to take away just
the divisions that we place on ourselves because we all have the right to jobs.
We all have the right to live in a community where we all have a voice and I want to thank
you for giving us the opportunity to share our voice with you this evening and to encourage
you and to remember that the world is watching what we are doing.
So please act with the best intentions of all of us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Good evening.
My name is Brian Nury.
I'm a resident of the OPEC in District and candidate for school board in case anyone's
watching.
I took, I was watching the news the other day on WDVM and I saw delegate Iraq being
interviewed about the events of last month's event and to be honest with you, I think he
has a point.
We shouldn't protect people just because of the choices that they make.
Referring to the sexual harassment policy that we have in Frederick County for the employment,
religion, marital status and veteran status are also protected statuses under the policy.
So what would prevent, let's say, an atheist who works for the county government to not
want to work with a Christian or possibly a single man who doesn't want to work with
a married woman, those were choices that they made.
Obviously you can see the ridiculousness of my comment.
I've read Jonathan Swiss mouth as proposal too.
So basically what I'm trying to say is that we need to rescind what we rescinded last month
because the whole argument is really coming down to an argument between the Civil Rights
Act in 1964, Title VII, and the Vanta Dillon Rule, which was originally established to prevent
localities from enacting local taxes without the permission of the state government.
However, lately, people like delegate Iraq have used it and abused it to prevent localities
from enacting certain policies that go against his personal beliefs.
I'm sorry, but personal beliefs don't have any standing when it comes to representing
everyone.
As has been said before, Arlington City, Alexandria, and the City of Charlottesville all
protect in one way, shape, or form, sexual orientation, and gender identity.
Just for clarification too, 17 jurisdictions in the state of West Virginia have the same
protections that we rescinded last month, including Martinsburg, Charlestown, and Shepherdstown.
Is West Virginia really more progressive than Virginia here?
Marriage equality was passed in 2015.
Even the EEOC in 2012 established that gender identity discrimination is prohibited because
it counts as sexual discrimination, which, under Title VII, was already banned.
In 2015, sexual orientation was also prohibited from being a point of discrimination, as it
was considered sexual discrimination.
I simply ask for us to think about the future, think about our community, and let's reconsider
rescinding that policy, because let's face it, we're a community, we need to accept all
of us.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Anyone else?
Yes, ma'am?
Sorry, so my name is Amanda Kelly, I just moved into the Gainesboro District at the beginning
of August, right when this started, I actually used to be one of Deligate LaRoc's constituents,
and it's like I moved, and he's still messing up my life.
I think that the large majority of Americans don't even know that it's not unconstitutional
to discriminate against people for their sexual orientation or their gender identity.
Most people think that that's against the law.
The fact that you offered it to people, even just happening now, is kind of way behind
the times, and it should always have been, whether it's a choice, whether it's not a choice,
it's none of your employer's business, and people should not be afraid to lose their
job just for living their life the way they want to, especially if it's not hurting anyone
else.
So I think that you definitely need to work on re-offering those protections to people.
I've worked in a lot of different businesses, I've been a manager, and every single one
of them, we're clearly trained that it's not okay to discriminate against customers,
employees, anything like that, and these are all protections that your average everyday
employer offers for the government not to offer the same protections that your general
store offers to its employees is a little ridiculous.
So I think that it's definitely time to offer those.
If other places are able to do it within Virginia, then you all can do it too, and I don't
think it would be very hard to figure out.
That's it, thank you.
Is there anyone else who would like to comment, anyone, or any issue, yes ma'am?
Like to thank you for my opportunity for me to speak.
I am, my name is Tabitha Shane-Holzer, I am also a member of the LGBTQ Support Group,
we matter, Winchester.
I am a 50 plus year resident of Frederick County, I just moved in a year ago to Steven City,
and this will bring up a point, I am a transgendered woman, and I have over almost 40 years
of work experience and construction, and I have experienced being told, oh, I don't
want to hire you because you're transgender, well, I've managed companies and everything,
and my viewpoint is when it comes to your employee, their sexual orientation, order, gender,
identity should not really matter, what should matter is their abilities, and everything
what they bring to the job.
When I was managing a business, I much rather had a person that was there every day, gave
110%, did their work, I didn't care if they were, their partner was the same gender or
anything, that should not really matter, what, like I said, employees should be based
on their merits, other work ethics, thank you.
Thank you, is there anyone else who would like to comment?
Anyone? Last call?
We'll close the public comment portion, and we appreciate you coming and sharing.
I will bring us to Board of Supervisors comments, are there, Mr. Chairman.
Supervisors done.
Let's share the HR committee.
We got some additional information after we had initially had an HR committee meeting.
The last month I did vote to move it back to HR, and we're having now discussions with
the HR director to find language that is going to be compatible with state law.
We are going to bring back the issue up, we'll address that issue, we did not have the
policy discussion at the first meeting, we're going to have a much more in-depth policy
discussion when we address this in the HR committee, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Anyone else?
Anyone?
Mr. Chairman Loft?
Mr. Chairman, I move we adjourn.
Those two adjourns are second.
Second.
Second, any discussion?
All those in favor are aye.
Aye.
Aye.
We'll stand adjourned.
We certainly thank everyone for their time, attention.
Safe travels home.
