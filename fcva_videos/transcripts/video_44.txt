Let me go and just give you review where we have been on the taxes, between 2015 and
today the tax rate has risen from 56 cents to 61 cents, we have also had to real estate
of praise and crises, but the total tax increase has been about 29.9 per cent almost 30
per cent in the last 4 years, but it has been 33 per cent for those in lowest bottom
25%, tax increases effect both lower in the middle class and a additional tax increase
will mean that we will spend some place in the neighborhood of a additional 8.5% or
almost $344.00. That money can make a car payment, can make food for a month, can pay
for medical bills and a number of other items. Next. This is a description of the house
value increases, and as you can see, those in the bottom 25% have had a much more significant
increase in the last 4 years, 33% than those in the top 25% which has only been 22.
Next. A couple years ago, we had a discussion on capital improvements, and I asked the school
board, was there anything in this budget that could be changed? The total cost was $286
million, but after payment of principal and interest, there have been $414 million. And
the answer was no, everything was really important. So from the school capital improvements
plan, it showed that we would spend about $14.9 million, and I know that may be hard
to say, next slide. But in 14.9 million two years ago, we would need approximately
$36.9 just to meet this capital cost as a $22 million increase, and that would only
cover the capital cost for the schools. If you also put in the capital cost on a traditional
5743 split, that would have to be $38.6, almost $0.39. A couple years ago, the former chairman
said my numbers were sensational. These aren't sensational numbers. These are just
trying to solve a problem. If the school board said that they need certain items, this
is what the cost is, and this data all comes from the school board. Pre-K, two years ago,
the administration came forward and said that they wanted a pre-K program, but no local
dollars were going to be involved. In the last two years, we've had $254,000 of local
dollars and another $295,000 this year. That's $550,000 for local dollars. That can
buy five and a half school buses. There are options in the private sector for pre-K.
The question becomes, which is more important, pre-K or five and a half school buses. Under
school capacity, two years ago, the school capacity for the county was approximately
$14,000. Today is possibly $13,000. The board made an arbitrary decision to go and vote
that differential. That eliminated 683 elementary suits. That's 683 elementary suits. We then
built a school for $28.5 million for 500 students. What we spend is a taxpayer. It's
$28.5 million, and we have less capacity than we did before. That decision to lower
the capacity was an arbitrary decision. It was not a mandatory decision. It could have
been relied for just new schools, not all schools. We've also had a number of programs
in the schools, and one is deep equity. That program here is an excellent program if
you have certain objectives. This is the handbook that was handed out, which I've gone
through, and read. It's more than $100,000 on training. It helps teachers, help students,
and that is commendable to do. We want teachers to go and help students. It encourages
teachers to go and say, Johnny or Susie, you can do better and work with you. Don't tell
me that you just can't do it. We will help you go and go from D's to B's. It also includes
such things as social dominance and social justice. The question is, is this educational
or political? Does this help teachers teach, or does this political indoctrination? One
of the comments in the book says that a political party, and I won't name the names, masks
racism with the guise of patriotism, but we've come from a situation where we've had multiple
people with different views doing that. For those of you that have been through this
contact me, if you thought it was a good program, I'd like to hear it. If you thought it
was a bad program, I'd like to hear what the results have been on this program. Let's
solve problems. In spring of 2017, the high school projected there would be 404 students
over capacity. This board voted 9.2 million dollars to solve that problem by adding an
extension to Millbrook to meet that need. In August of 2017, the school administration
then projected 500 seats over capacity in five years. My question is, what occurred
in those four months between the spring and August to make such a huge difference in
capacity numbers? We were trying to solve a problem. If our proposal had gone through,
we would have saved subsidies in the neighborhood of $80 million that could have been done for
other items. The question is, why did they reject it in favor of a $90 million school
when we provided a solution, especially to the English teacher at Millbrook who said
that she had to teach off a cart. I remember her comments. I thought, this helps to solve
her problem and we need to solve that problem. What's the definition of a 30 mile radius?
The school administration gave us a chart which will show you in a second on 30 miles,
which includes those counties in Virginia, but it did not include the counties in West
Virginia. And teachers from some of those counties do come to Virginia to teach next
slide. So last year, the administration showed
this slide here that shows that Frederick County had a higher teacher pay than the average
of that 30 mile radius, which was only in Virginia. This year, as you can see, that average
is going down and the green line represents the average blue line represents Frederick County
schools, and that is only for those in Virginia. Next slide. And then, to encourage teacher
retention, this slide was shown here, which says that Frederick County is the second
lowest of pay for starting teachers. And all that information is good, accurate information,
which is part of the process. Next slide. But this is a slide that changes the equation.
This slide shows that if you remove loud in county, then we are paying more than the
adjacent counties, and we are paying more than the average of all those other Virginia
counties. So we're going to have an intellectual discussion here. Let's include that as well.
And then the question becomes, if you had included the counties of West Virginia, that
slide would even change more. I think it would be good to see just what a true 30 mile
radius companion would be. Go ahead. Next slide. This is an example of the percentage
of what we pay for teachers versus loud in county. In loud in county, the average household
income is about $129,000, ours is $71,000, or put it another way, they are 82 percent
more than we are. And if you look at this chart, we pay more as a percentage of income
than loud in county. For example, first year teachers, loud in county pays about 39 percent,
we're paying 59 percent. For teachers in 30 years here, loud in county pays 73 percent,
we pay 94 percent. And if you have a Ph.D., we actually pay more 101 percent of the
loud in county income than loud in county does. Next slide. Budgets. We're lack there
We have a budget. That's why we're here. We're talking about budgets and how to solve these
problems. It's taxpayer money, and everything is open for whatever we need to see. The school
also is using taxpayer money, but their budget is only one to three pages. It doesn't go into
the depth to answer questions such as, how much money was used for school design? I know that
money was used in the last five years for school design, but it doesn't show how much.
How much was used for pre-K? How much was used for safety officers? Plus the administrative
overhead of each school, and you can go on. Next slide. And what we need to have is a budget
that we can look for, look through the details, see what's there, and have a good discussion
on what's in it. Last year, I made a request for the budget, and I was to not, and I don't
appreciate that. This year, another supervisor made a request for a budget, and that's not been
provided. If we're about to go and vote on a significant budget, we'd like to see what the
details are. I'd like to encourage the school board and the administration to provide that budget
with sub-tannical or go funding, so we can go through and look ahead and see what's in it.
We're going to spend almost $100 plus million, yet how do I vote on a $100 million bill
when I haven't seen the details? Next slide. One of the problems that we're all facing is
a continuation of growth. I'll only be two more minutes, Chair. Mr. Chairman,
one minute. In 1930, we had 13,000 people in Frederick County. In 1990, we had 45,000.
In 2000, we had 60,000. Yet today, we have almost 90,000. We've had more people coming into
this county in the last 30 years that were here for the last 100 years. We had 50% more come
in than the last 100 years. And how do we address that growth? Next slide.
I'm going to just propose some solutions, and they aren't the perfect solutions, but they're
starting point. We can increase the real estate tax. That's one of the things that this board is
going to discuss. We can have a change in the meals tax. Three weeks ago, this was a good proposal,
and when the economy returns, this is still going to be a good proposal. We can change the law
to allow impact fees for new buildings. We can have the law change for capital costs recovery.
We can have a transfer tax for recovery fees for new buildings and for sales. We can have
a freeze on taxes for those that are here, such as standing in San Diego, California, and those
people that move in would have a different tax to cover their capital costs and operating costs.
We can also change the requirements for BRS so that instead of being paid for the top three
years, they're paid for the average of three years. And if you have other suggestions,
we'll have to hear them. Next slide.
So I'd like to say, let's work together to solve these problems. For those of you that are
interested in the school board, for those of you that are interested here as board members,
let's get together and set around a table and walk through some of the issues and see if we can
find some results. It's been told we can't do it that we have. We have changed the
proper law in the last couple years. There is a meals tax change that's going to become prominent
whether it's introduced this year, next year, is unseen, but when it does come in the economy
recovers, that's going to be worth another $3 million. And we can make the decisions to go and
try to work together to solve problems as opposed to talking at each other and talk with each other.
So I look forward to working with the school board and with the board members to see if we can
find solutions that work for everybody for those that have been here a long time, for those that
have come in and see if we can't work together to find common solutions for the good of all of us.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir. Mr. President Grayburn.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to give a little
history lesson on where I've come from and where I'm going with my small presentation.
We started this process in January trying to get a budget together and we met with the
school board on 26th of February and what I was hoping to be a constructive meeting where we'd
be able to look at their budget and have a real breakdown and have some questions answered.
I went into that meeting with some questions, five questions particularly and came out of
there with the same five questions as when I asked Superintendent Savine, five different questions
I was repeatedly denied an answer. I followed up with Mr. Foreman who's chairman of the
school board as well as Brandon Monk who is the back creek district school board representative
and they have been very helpful in their attempts to provide as much information as they could
regarding the school board's budget and I am very very thankful for the work that they put forth
and the willingness that they've had to work together. I think it is a great first step.
However, in front of you here is a slide that is from Dr. Savine.
So immediately after the 26th of February I followed up on the 28th two days later with a
request for information. I still had the same five questions.
And some of the questions that I was asking was to simply align out a budget.
You see if you look at Loudoun County's budget it's well over 300 pages from their school board
and the board can really look at what the needs are and what the things may not be as pressing
of a need. To put this in perspective I had a lot of teachers when I ran for the board of
supervisors last year tell me my school has a lot of maintenance issues that need to be addressed
and they shared with me some of those concerns and I agree that there are a lot of concerns and a
lot of needs that the school system needs to address. I also look at the budget which I'll show
here in a little bit and I see that they are also receiving a very high quantity of money
and I wonder where is all of this money going. So I ask Mr. Savine, Superintendent Savine,
for an outline or a line item budget. As you will see you'll go to the next slide here.
This was his response. He gave me a partial response four of the five questions he answered but he
would not provide me with a line item budget. I'll just read it here for you as was noted in
their sponsor descent on March the 6th wheat and this is Savine's words here exactly from his
email. We cannot provide a detailed school budget for fiscal year 21 at this time as the budget
will not be final until the 21st of April. Skip down there to the bottom paragraph however
because I did file for you does not require public bodies to produce records such as a detailed
fiscal year 21 budget that do not exist. Once a detailed budget for the upcoming year has been
finalized it will be posted on our website and we will write it for the issue request to copy.
My question is how are we spending a hundred million dollars on something if we don't know where
it's going. I am extremely concerned that we are opening ourselves up to a mouthpieces or a
misceases opportunity as what happened to Warren County and TDA where there was not oversight
of their budget. I am not accusing the school board of misappropriating funds. I'd simply like to
know where it's going. Next slide. This was my response from my official FOIA's request.
So my FOIA's was originally filed on the 28th of February. This was received on the 18th of March.
I'm not going to go into full detail here or depth but if you go to the next slide I just wanted
to pull a couple of things from it. These are exact dissertations from it. I was told by Mr. Edwards
of the school division that we anticipated it will take 20 hours of staff time to review and
prepare the documents that I have requested. As you see there as of today our staff has
spent our pocket one and a half hours gathering the information in response to your request.
You see the cost. I've sent them a check for $99.64 by the way, my own money.
Going a little further down, given the time estimates provided above for accessing
duplicating, supplying and fully searching the records, we estimate that the division will incur
a cost of $7,471.31 to respond to your FOIA request based upon the hourly wage.
For each staff member who's processing these records, I want to make something very clear.
I was asked to pay $7,471.31 just to see a few documents that would help me understand
where that $100 million that we're going to give them is going. I ask for a simple line item
budget so I could see for myself. I didn't want to take up their time. I know they're busy.
But I'd like to know where the money that we are getting them is going. I think it's only fair.
I think it's only right. Either a line item budget or maybe we can go to the categorical
funding route. But I think this is absolutely wrong to ask me to spend $7,471.31 out of my own
pocket from my wages that I go to work for every day just to make sure that the funds are being
appropriated in areas that I believe are of the best use to our students, our teachers,
and the residents of our county as a whole. Next slide.
I know it's hard to see this, but if you go to page one of our budget, you will see
that we did not cut the school's proposed budget. We have not cut the school's budget for
this year. In fact, it has increased greatly. Not only have we increased their general
budget, but we have increased their debt service, the amount of money that we're using to
service their debt, it is very frustrating to me. The cat and mouse game that has been played
by the superintendent of the schools. I've asked for information. It has been denied.
FOIA's request timelines have been blatantly violated. It is very frustrating to me that I cannot
get some accurate numbers to be able to sit down with Mr. Foreman and with Mr. Muckub and more
than willing to do so and have a good conversation. Just like Mr. Dunstated, I would love to sit down
and solve these problems together. But until I have some information to work off of, it's hard
to know how we can best attack the problem. Thanks for your time.
Thank you, sir. Any other board comments?
You want Mr. Chairman? Just 30 seconds. Mr. Foreman has been very, very helpful. I have had two
meetings from Mr. Foreman since he became chair. Both have been highly constructive. They look
to have the same type of meeting with everybody else. Mr. Foreman, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Thank you. Thank you, sir. Anyone else? All right. Thank you. We'll move on to
the county officials' committee appointments. Mark Parks and Rec. How would we like to handle that one?
Chairman? Yes, sir. I would like to appoint Mr. Foreman. Yes. I would like to appoint Mr.
Foreman to the parks and Rec. He comes from Redbide, although I think it might be Mr. Welles
who should make that appointment. He's on the parks and Rec's Leo's on, so.
That's fine. You can do that. You just did. He can. All right, that's fine. Okay, we don't need
to go in detail. Any discussion? All those in favour? Aye. I oppose. No. Mr. Dennis Grubbs
is appointing the parks and Rec's commission. We appreciate his service. There are adoption of
the remote meeting policy. Move for adoption. Move to adopt second. Tacking. Any discussion?
All those in favour? Aye. Opposed? No. Thank you. Item number 8c is a resolution authorizing
the treasure to obtain a land of credit. I would like to handle that one. It is in front of you.
Move for authorization. Move motion in a second. Second. Any discussion?
Yes. Chairman? Yes, sir. I see this as a tool and our tool kit that we will need as we move
forward in this uncertain financial times. There are quests for a $50 million line of credit that would
help us cover expenses for the county. The only thing that I would ask is that before we
would tap into something like this and start spending that money, that we as a body have some
input into the timing and the use of those funds should they come forward because I think
with all of the unknowns before us, I think there's going to be some changes in the next
few months over a year as things move forward with our budgets. So while I'm in favour of giving
the treasure the authorization to move forward with putting this tool in our tool kit, I would like
to ask that we be included in the spending decisions moving forward.
I don't like to speak for the treasure, but he pays bills to the money that he has and manages.
Once the bill is being created, we sort of have to pay. I don't disagree with you. I trust the
treasure is going to do the right thing. I would just like the courtesy of this body who is authorizing
the borrowing of the money to have input, and I'm sure that he would do that for us anyway,
but I just wanted to make that clear.
Dean Shaken is head and the correct direction.
All right, sir. Any further discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I agree with Mr. McCarthy's comments. I am extremely
concerned to see us continue to go into debt. However,
this is something that if we do not do now, I'm fearful that we may not have a line of
credit extended to us at a future date due to liquidity issues. So I think it is the right move
to secure that line of credit as it is a very low cost to the county to have it secured
and should the need arise that we have to dip into it. I think that the approach that
Supervisor McCarthy has granted or has outlined is a good way to address the concern.
Great, sir. Further, anyone?
Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I had a good conversation with the Treasury yesterday. The only thing I like to add to this is that
3, 4, 5, 6 months from now, at some point in time the treasure feels as appropriate that we come
back and have a discussion on ending this because it is cost in the county a small amount of
money each month. So once we get through this virus issue and things to have some returns and
we're almost saying I'd like to see if we can have a conversation to end the line of credit if it's
no longer needed.
I know, as I said, I appreciate the comments with the Treasury yesterday.
Yes, all right. Further discussion, anyone?
Supervisor Graber.
Aye.
Supervisor Dun.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor McCartney.
Aye.
Supervisor Fisher.
Aye.
Chair votes aye in the motion carries.
Resolution authorizing.
That's when we just did.
I mean, yeah.
We didn't do.
We did do.
Do we do adoption of the remote meeting?
Yes.
We did.
Yes.
There we go.
There we are.
Okay, so this will bring us to 8D, which is the Declaration of Local Emergency.
How would the board like to handle this?
Adoption.
Motion to approve.
Sir, second.
A second.
And a second.
Discussion.
Anyone?
All right.
Mr Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I would just make a similar request to the County Administrator
with regard to this that, you know, with regard to emergency spending.
I know that our County Administrator has always done a good job of keeping us in the loop
I would just ask that that continue that we've made aware of all, you know, unusual spending
that might be necessary or necessitated by the emergency.
Mr Chairman.
Yes, sir.
If I may.
I would also, if the County Administrator doesn't mind,
when he gives us our weekly update, if he wouldn't mind giving us an update of what is
in spent to date that you know of, we would, I would appreciate knowing that.
Well, in full disclosure, I mean, what typically happens in a situation like this is we incur expenses,
and it's an emergency declaration as the title indicates.
So some of those expenditures would be things such as overtime or supplies that need to be purchased.
I'm not necessarily going to be in a position to know when those expenditures get made,
because they're going to be made in the course of daily activities as needed.
We would keep tabs on those ultimately and the whole purpose of that would be to submit
those expenses for reimbursement to the federal government, but I don't want to mislead the
board in any way for my ability to keep you and the loop as those dollars get spent,
it's going to be fairly challenging.
You're asking me?
He answered my question.
Okay, all right, further discussion, anyone?
Chairman.
Supervisor Doug.
One of the reasons we're doing this declaration of an emergency is that if there's been
reimbursement from the federal government or the state government by doing that it makes us
eligible for that, so the county administrator will do whatever discussion he needs to do,
but one of the reasons for this is because of that reimbursement possibility.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Anyone else?
Further discussion?
Supervisor McCarthy.
Sorry, Supervisor Fisher.
No, no, no, you don't get a break.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
Thank you, sir.
Supervisor Slotter.
Hi.
Supervisor Wells.
Hi.
Supervisor Dye.
Hi.
Supervisor Gray.
Hi.
Supervisor Dye and the motion carries.
I'll bring us to a resolution to schedule a special meeting on April 1.
How would the board like to handle that one?
Mr Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I'd like us to postpone it at least for two weeks just because we were sort of in the midst of
changing environment with regard to the economy and finances.
I think, earlier today, the county administrator issued a memo to his staff, which I think was a
wise move, asking them to start looking hard at their numbers, hold back on making any
unplanned expenditures and kind of sort of start to prepare for what could be hard times ahead,
and I think that was a good move on his part.
I think before we vote on the budget moving forward, we may need one more work session just to
discuss the pros and cons of a budget, that's my opinion.
I have to suggest that we have a scheduled meeting a week later on the 8th.
I'm not opposed to that.
I just think we need to have an intervening meeting for another work session.
Work session between now and the 8th is what you're suggesting.
Whether that's a telephonic work session or something, I think it would be helpful.
We can do a work session that way. We can't bail on the budget that way.
Mr. Chairman.
The longer we put my concern is, the longer we put it off, the more opportunity there might be
for somebody to keep us from being able to meet. So go ahead, sir.
I would concur with Mr. McCarthy's comments. I believe we need to have a work session.
I would also like to ask, as a board here, if we could have some conversations, I would like
to thank the Mr. Chair for the memo that he did sent out. It was a well-worded and well-directed
memo, but I think we should go one step further. I believe that we ought to ask our finance
office to look at what a 3% and a 5% and a 10% reduction in
budget would look like based off of this year's figures and have that available for our
work session or budget work session. As Mr. McCarthy has mentioned, I believe that while I
strongly don't want to see us have to cut government functions, I think that we are in a
situation where we may be in unparalleled times, financially, with what we are facing with the
virus. I believe that we need to at least have the numbers in front of us to have an open
honest discussion on what 3%, 5%, and a 10% cut would look like. I would propose that we do not
cut public safety as they will be taxed very heavily during this time frame, so social services
in public safety would be exempt from that, but I would like to see what the 3%, 5%, 10% cut
on 2019's budget would look like as far as based off the numbers of 2019.
3, 5, and 10? 3, 5, and 10. Yes, sir.
Got it. All right, further comments, Chairman.
Yes, sir. I concur with Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Graver. I would like to have the 7th of a step together,
and whoever else wants to join us, just have the opportunity to talk through what's occurred
in the last three weeks, which has been pretty significant. You see, what changes should
have been made because of it, so I just have the opportunity to talk and discuss.
So I would not be in favor of next week having a board vote, but moving it back to, you know,
two weeks from now in the interim. Eight? The eighth is fine with me.
And so we'll schedule a work session if we can, and then we also have to check with other
staff to make sure they can be available. The original budget calendar had a budget work session
on April 1st, so hopefully that's penciled into most of your schedules. So if we don't have a
special formal board meeting, we could back down to having the work session if that's the desire of the board.
I don't want to put you on the spot, but do you think finance can have the 3, 5, and 10?
Thank you.
Thank you.
By the first.
Yes, ma'am.
We'll enjoy whatever you can put together. That'll work on it.
It only gives them two days. We do it on the first.
Yes.
That's what it looks like.
Hey, discussion.
All right. I'm not sure I heard that in the form of a motion that we
make our, just put our decision off until our meeting on the 8th and that we schedule
to plan to have the schedule work session on the 1st.
And staff will have to get to us with a time, place, and a format because it still has to be a
public meeting. Your current schedule is for a work session on the 1st and your regular meeting
on the 8th, so there's really no change needed. That's what you want to do.
That's the motion. We're good.
I think the default is that's what we're doing. I don't, I don't, I don't think you need a motion.
Okay. 8th of the budget?
Yes. Okay. I just, yes.
That would allow for the remote meeting policy. I mean, that would be like a telecom meeting
that we've done with some of the other, the first. I don't know on the budget.
I understand that, but the first we would do is we would all dial in as we've done with some
of the other meetings. You still have to have a quorum present, even with that remote policy.
Some of you, if you needed to, could remote in, but we need a quorum to have the public
meeting still. That has not been relaxed at this point. Right.
Okay. Are we finished?
I mean, we could have them, I'll be here for a week if that's what I'll be glad, at least one of the four to be here for.
I'll be here.
If something happens, I'll be here when I actually meet remote policy.
We'll either have four or we won't, and we can't see ten days.
All right, so we're good on that one.
All right, I think I'll make a motion to do that. I believe there has not been a motion made.
So I'll make a motion to do a budget meeting on the board.
Already scheduled, and our regular schedule, we don't need a motion, is where we just finished.
Okay. Yes. Okay.
Let me go. All right, there's no committee business.
And we're ready to open the public hearing for our citizens to come in on our proposed physical year 2021 budget.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That is my time.
Thank you.
I'll run it right there.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Budget numbers, as they existed at the time that the board ran the public hearing ad.
Our stated priorities coming out of administration and with the consent of the board were public safety and education were highest priorities.
We as county administration were trying to address some critical staffing needs.
Obviously, we all want to try and minimize any tax increase.
From the administrative side, we were trying to implement a miracle increase.
We need to fund our public safety radio system upgrade.
We, as administration, were hoping to re-institute and fund a portion of our tuition assistance program.
And also provide some assistance to the volunteers as they've requested for the last couple of years for fuel.
They've also requested funding for insurance.
Where we are with general numbers are projected revenue for the coming year.
That includes a proposed 500 tax increase was 202,770, a 766 million.
That is a $12 million increase over the previous fiscal year.
As you can see from the lower half of that slide, the natural increase, which is that that occurs just from general economic growth, was close to $5 million, $4.7,
and almost $4.8.
The real estate tax increase has proposed with roughly $5.5 million.
And then we have other categorical funding increases that are remarked for certain companies.
Significant increases that attribute to that increase in the proposed budget, the juvenile and adult detention centers had about a $600,000 increase.
As we all know, we've got about $800,000 increase in school debt coming up.
The school operating increases about $5 million.
The cost to do a 3% merit co-lo is about a million and a half.
The anticipated cost for VRS increases in health insurance increases is another million and a half.
And then positions and equipment as we ended up funding in the proposed budget were another million and a half.
So that's what makes up that additional funding.
A large percentage of that, as you could see from the previous slide, the new positions are listed here.
I would just point out, we're proposing to fund 12 of 37 requested positions.
The sheriff actually requested 8.
I'm sorry, 11 new positions and fire and rescue requested 16.
Parks and Recrequested 3.
So those are what we were able to fund as proposed with the revenue derived from the proposed increase.
This is just, as you can see, a very simplistic breakdown of our advertised budget in terms of where the funding is.
62% of that, 355 million is accounted for by the schools.
18% of it goes to public safety and the other 20% funds, everything else.
When we sort of zero in on the general fund portion, you can see that, again, this is where our revenue comes from.
We can see by a far cry the large percentage of that is general property tax at 68% and then another 19% from other local taxes so that you can see that 90%, roughly 90% of that funding is derived from local taxes.
When you look at the expenditures where that funding goes, again, you can see that between public safety in the green and the schools and the large blue section of the pie, you've got 75% of our expenditures in those two categories and then you see the other pieces of the pie.
This is an attempt to sort of show over the last five years the increases in these various categories.
Interestingly, when you look at the past five years, you can see that all these categories, public safety, education and then all others have increased.
But the largest share that increases is essentially in our public safety realm.
In terms of number of employees, this is just another way of looking at what's happened in the last number of years.
We've added 112 positions in five years. Of those 112 positions, 88 of them have been in public safety and in the Department of Social Services.
Percentage-wise, interestingly, although it's the smallest portion of that, bar chart, the dark blue, as a percentage of numbers are Department of Social Services has grown the most as a percentage.
And as you know, that's primarily a result of the increased benefits that came about.
Local capital, this is right out of the school's proposal, you can see some of their priorities and where they're proposing to utilize that $3.7 million.
On the other side, we've got roughly 200,000 in proposed capital that's not counting our radio system upgrade.
That's principally vehicles associated with new positions. The 101,000 for Abrams Creed is a grant.
At the public safety radios, first phase of that, we're projecting at 6.8 million. The RFP for that project is just within, I think, the last day gone public.
So once we get some middles in, we'll be able to zero in on that dollar amount a little more accurately and that will require an appropriation at some point in the future.
So operating debt, I had mentioned this earlier, you can see that we're looking at close to a $9 million increase in operating another $1,000,000 to in school debt for a total of not quite $11,000,000.
Looking at where the schools revenue comes from, you can see that there's an equals split between what they get from the state and what they get from our transfer and then a little bit of federal money and some other miscellaneous funds, but clearly the lion's share of the funding is between us and the state.
The school operating budget, again over the last number of years, you can see that on an annual basis, that is increased between 4% and 5% each year for the last five years.
So our transfer to the schools again over the last five years has been between 3% and 6%. The current proposed increases just under 6.6%, 5.7%.
We're trying to take a look at where we are in the general sense. This is a current year, I mean in terms of building permits and as you can see, we've only got two months worth of data right now.
We're behind where we were last year in new building permits for new residential dwellings, hard to know what the current situation will do to that figure moving forward.
This is a historical look at building of new dwellings in the county going back to the 90s. You can see we had a peak of 1200 in some units back in 05 and when we had the recession, we went down to a point where we were at the very bottom.
We built 275 new residences in 2010 and you can see that's been creeping back up the last couple years. It seems to have leveled off at just under 800 units.
It's hard to know where we go now but I think it's safe to say that the growth pressures are going to be with us for the foreseeable future.
Another look is population and Mr. Dunn touched on this a little earlier but you can see the rate of population increases is steadily accelerating.
This table goes back to the 90s, I believe, on my other time reading from here myself, 1940, I'm sorry.
You can see that the rate of growth is increasing, that line is getting steeper.
If you look at projections in the future, the anticipation is the line remains fairly steady but fairly steep as well.
The situation we're in is not likely to change dramatically, I don't think.
Now again, our current situation is anybody's guess in terms of what the impact of that is going to be in the long haul.
This is a look at historic tax rates going back to 2000. You can see in the early 2000s we were up in 70 cents.
There was a significant rollback in 05 and we've fluctuated around but had increases in number of times in the last 20 years.
You can see that the proposed rate of 66 cents where that puts us in terms of historical context.
There's been some talk lately about our personal property tax rate, that's remained quite constant.
You can see there was a big increase back in 08 but the rate has remained unchanged other than that significant bump back in 08.
In terms of where we go from here, you've settled some of this. We'll have a work session on the first.
We'll have your regularly meeting on the eighth. Just wanted to kind of remind everyone of where we are in terms of the basis.
We have to touch tax bills, have to hit the street in mid-April.
We've got to calculate tax relief, et cetera. So there's some hard deadlines that we have to meet.
With that, that's my presentation. I can try and answer the questions if you have them.
I'm not sure if we have any public here to comment but we can find out.
We'll find out. Any questions of Mr. Tierney?
All right, thank you. So this is a public hearing. Has anyone come to speak with us?
Mr. Chairman, no one has signed up to speak. We'll just let you know that you have received more than 80 comments before tonight's meeting.
The email or through the website and we will continue to receive those comments up until the time that you vote on the budget.
It's important that our community do that and realize that you all have done a great job of advertising that and keeping it in the forefront of the discussion.
I appreciate that. There's no one to come comment in person.
We'll close the public comment portion of the discussion.
And I think that we have decided where we're going to move on.
And so we'll get together then. There's no planning commission business.
We'll go to planning commission business, other planning business.
Supervisor McCarthy, you had a discussion you'd like to have.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Two or three meetings ago, there was a discussion on reducing CUP fees for filings of CUPs for towers for internet or cellular service if a tower was 50 feet or higher.
The consensus at the board at that point was that the fee should be reduced to something more reasonable, something in line with covering the costs of the advertising of the CUP for the county.
I believe the committee has met it. The planning commission has been unable to meet meetings have been cancelled with the emergency that's in place.
There's no foreseeable eminent meeting of the planning commission.
There are however citizens who need to make application for CUP.
The current rate is still at $7,000. So tonight I'd like to move to make an emergency ordinance amendment that would last for a fixed period to get us through until the planning commission can meet.
I put in front of you a copy of the ordinance and I'll read it for you.
It says number one, the President of the United States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia and the Board of Supervisors have each declared states of emergency relative to the COVID-19 pandemic.
And in the context of that emergency, the Board of Supervisors finds that better enabling mobile telecommunications is especially critical objective during the COVID-19 pandemic.
And adopts the following amendment to the county code, pursuant to the emergency provisions of the second paragraph of section 15.2-1427F of the Virginia Code.
Paragraph two, the Board of Supervisors hereby ordains that for the period from March 25, 2020 to May 24, 2020, the first sentence of section 165-204.19C2 of the county code regarding the fee for applications for standard process projects for commercial telecommunications facilities.
B, and hereby, is amended to read any person seeking to install a facility or structure pursuant to this subsection.
Shall make application to the zoning administrator accompanied by a payment of $750.
I apologize. There are two copies here.
Paragraph three states the provisions of this ordinance shall expire on May 24, 2020 unless oner before that date, the Board of Supervisors adopts the same pursuant to the regular requirements of section 15.2-107, section 15.2-1427, and section 15.2-204 of the Code of Virginia.
So the purpose of this proposed amendment is simply to allow us to go ahead and enact the lower fee.
It doesn't change the requirement that someone still has to apply for and get approved a conditional use permit, but just to lower the fee to $750 to make it more accessible to our citizens to have access to these towers and the necessary services provided by putting the Wisp services on those towers.
So, in essence, carries out what we had asked the Planning Commission to do in the interim until they have a chance to actually get that job done.
The reason I'm putting this forward is I think that in this time of an emergency, when people are so reliant upon their internet service, it only makes good sense for us not to create obstacles for people to access that service during the year.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to know that we had done this.
Review it with the Sunset Clause. Do we set ourselves up for any other concerns?
It passes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. McCarthy actually called me earlier and I prepared it for him.
The Sunset Clause is appropriate.
Section 15.21427F has the emergency clause in it for a situation presumably like this one.
I do have a question. The draft says $500 and Mr. McCarthy said $750.
My motion would be for $750. I spoke with Supervisor Slotter before the meeting and she indicated that the committee had said $750 would be the cost of the required.
I think he attempted to amend his resolution draft in that way. Are we okay with that?
I'm fine as long as that's motion that's made, that's fine and we'll make sure that the version, if the board approves it, we'll make sure that the version has the right number.
Thank you, sir. Just one moment. A second.
A second.
Now we're into discussion, but I'm going to interrupt us one moment. Mr. Tibbs.
Okay, thank you. Supervisor Slotter, discussion.
Yes, Mr. Williams. I believe you probably attended those meetings as my recollection correct on the 750.
There was, I'm not sure of that honestly. There was only one meeting. It was the development regulations review committee.
And I know they had two different numbers. I think they differentiated on height.
And I know one of those numbers was a four digit number. I want. I do not remember specifically, but I have some vague recollection of for over a hundred feet.
They said $1,500, or maybe it was 1,500 below and they wanted to keep the 7,000. They had a different view than the view that the board had is kind of referred.
But, but this ordinance would be for the hundred foot tower.
My intention is not to create different scales of cost as much as it is just to cover our advertising costs, which would be the same regardless of the height of the tower.
It's just to allow opportunity for citizens to come forward during this period, if necessary, in order to make CEP applications without having to pay the extraordinary amount of $7,000.
Mr. Chairman.
I was just going to point out it's only going to be an effect for two months.
My memory was, as yours is, Mr. Williams, that there was somewhat of a sliding scale. I just can't remember the hard number.
It was a sliding scale and I know their numbers were rather larger than what the board had originally talked about.
So, what we're discussing is a temporary measure. Is there any further discussion?
I have had a lot of folks reach out to me who have been working from home who do not normally work from home and who have had children doing school work or even college level work from home and many have expressed some of the difficulties that they have experienced getting quality broadband access or having access to the Internet.
I don't know how many folks would take us up on this offer, but I believe that it is in the environment that we are in.
It would only be who of us as a board to make it as business-friendly for folks who are trying to run their business out of their homes as we can to not only help our tax revenue, but to help our citizens keep bread on the table and to help our kids continue to be educated.
So, I can fully support what Mr. McCarthy has presented and as has been stated, there is a sunset clause in 60 days. If we don't like the car, we send it back.
So, I think that this is a most appropriate next stop.
I would add just one more item. One of the impetus that brought this forward was the county staff actually was working to carry out our directive and enforcing the existing ordinance against the pre-existing towers that have been put up in contravention of the ordinance.
And as part of that fallout, letters were going out to citizens who have towers on their properties that were unaware that their towers weren't in compliance. They had bought property years later after the tower has been put up.
And the way that the code is enforced is there's a center letter that says, you know, you need to get this taken care of within the next 30 days.
So, they came forward immediately and said, we want to do the right thing. What do we need to do? And when they found out about the $7,000 cost, they were really shocked and worried and thought, okay, do we need to have to take this tower down in the middle of a crisis where people may be relying upon this internet service.
I immediately reached out to Mr. Sharon, who is our zoning administrator, and he was very understanding, especially because those letters went out prior to the emergency happening.
I know our staff wouldn't do anything to create a stumbling box for our citizens, and he said he would work with the citizens in order to get us through this crisis, as long as they're showing some good will and some good faith.
And I think this is a way to make it able for them to come forward, file the necessary paperwork to come into compliance and help move that project forward in a time when we need to make sure that this is done in the best, most delicate way to make sure people have access to the internet that we need right now.
Thank you, Mr Chairman.
I'm not convinced that it will do what you just said you were hoping it would do, because they still have to be processed.
What's that? The applications still have to be processed.
I think the fee will be paid at the time, the application is submitted, so if the application is submitted next week, then they know that they don't have to pay the $7,000.
What is that they could easily not get through process by the time the Sunset Clause wipes it out?
But the fee, as I understand it, would be what was applicable the day they filed.
So if they file next week, then it would be the $750 fee regardless of when it gets processed.
Okay, Mr. Eames.
Yes, that's correct. The fee is just as based on when they file.
If this crisis goes away properly, the board will find itself quite busy over the summer with the Sunset Clause.
They haven't been lately. Further discussion, anyone?
Mr Chairman, if I understand this correctly, this goes through the traditional CUP process.
So if anybody has any idea, this is going to take care of providing internet access for the remainder of the school year, dream long.
Because it's going to take, they've got to be engineering stuff has to be done on these tires and they have to, if they collapse, they've got to collapse on themselves.
And who knows, they may not be made appropriately to meet current engineering standards and those types of things.
So if anybody is listening and thinks this is going to, you know, a magic wand and you're going to get internet service, I have no objection with reducing the fee for 60 days.
But I don't want anybody to just think it's going to be something that will happen overnight, it won't.
I would just point out the intention of it, isn't it?
Two towers coming in, but to keep towers currently up from coming down in a time when there's such a drastic need for internet service.
I have concern about the circumstances under which some of those went up.
I share those same concerns.
Thank you, sir. Further discussion?
Mr. Chairman. Yes.
I know because I have family and other rural areas throughout the state of Virginia and we're not the only county who does not have good service, good internet service, broadband service.
Wies County, Rapid Hanna County, Page County, their schools are out and they have no broadband service for their children down there.
It's one of the poorest counties in the state of Virginia.
That's why we're in this boat together trying to solve as unusual times as we say.
I support Mr. McCarthy's motion and he talked to me early today and I'm totally in favor of it.
It's a great way of showing that we're working and doing what we can.
The other thing being said, there's no quick fix to anything that we're doing, whether it be towers or anything else.
We are a microwave society and we like to snap our fingers and think that we can resolve these issues overnight and they won't be.
Even if you said, well, let's start doing that today.
Things don't get built overnight and things and I'm not so sure all the ideas that we talked about before.
We're going to solve the problems anyway.
But we're working on it and I think the best we could do is open those doors and do the best we can for our citizens at this time and I think this is a good move.
Thank you.
And I agree. I mean, we need to be moving forward on this issue.
Yes.
It's not easily solved.
Any further discussion?
Do I need a roll call on this?
It's an ordinance.
Yes.
So that would be Supervisor Grayward.
Aye.
Supervisor Dun.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Aye.
Supervisor Fisher.
Aye.
Chair votes, aye.
Motion carries.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
That's right.
We do have but we're not to that citizen comment section yet.
What are we going to do?
I'm sorry.
I had made a motion when we adopted the agenda.
I'm sorry you did my apologies.
I have you here.
That is okay.

I know that the gentleman that spoke earlier was asking you what have we done?
I know that you've worked hard on the chairman of this community to try to go and address this issue.
And so I'd like to just tell that gentleman that Mr. Tierney, along with the chairman,
has done a bunch of work in the last four or five days.
Mr. Tierney sent out a memo earlier today outlining what he's done in the last week.
And it's extensive, and it deals with this issue.
And he and the chairman have had significant talks together,
along with first responders on how to address this issue.
So we are addressing this issue, it's unknown, but we are addressing it to the best of our ability,
and we are adjusting as we go along.
So Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for your work.
Mr. Tierney, thank you for your work.
Mr. Chairman, if you would allow me, I just want to thank our staff,
our public safety folks, our finance people, our HR people,
everyone has really stepped up, and I can't take the credit for what's been done.
The people that work for me have really shown their stripes.
And I'm lucky that I have that support, and I think we all are.
We are as prepared as we can be.
We are as prepared as anybody could be.
We're going to get stretched most likely with what's coming.
And we'll address it to the best of our ability.
I'm very confident of that.
I would agree completely.
And I think that we owe staff and our dedicated folks, I mean,
we have extraordinary folks, and they have stepped up big time.
Our citizens have stepped up big time.
And we just very much appreciate you're doing what you do,
and we are still making all of this work.
And I'm confident that that will continue.
By Chairman Wells.
I just have one more thing before I say that.
That's okay.
We're going to get ready.
And that is, and Mr. Tierney kind of brought it to my attention when he said staff.
As I leave in the morning and come by,
Lance's pharmacy, there's a school bus parked out there, and they're passing out
lunches to our school children.
And I would like to thank our public school teachers and the people that work there
in their maintenance departments and so forth who are pitching in,
doing a wonderful job, making sure that our students are getting what they need to eat,
or getting what they need to learn doing the best they can.
I have a daughter-in-law who's a teacher, and she's just absolutely
upset that she did not get a chance to talk to her children before she left the classroom.
And I think that's where you see that love of children comes out in these folks' things.
And I know Dr. Savind's bright futures program has done a great job
with the making sure that food and so forth are gotten out to these folks.
So congratulations, again, it's all a Frederick County, and we're all one family,
and I think they're doing our outstanding job as well.
Thank you, Christopher, for reminding me about that with staff.
Yes, sir.
Looking for emotions.
How about this, Mr. Chairman?
I move, we adjourn.
Second.
Second.
All those in favor, aye?
All right, we'll stand adjourned.
I thank everyone for their commitment and dedication.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
