Okay. Option of the agenda. Any proposed changes?
Staff has none, Mr. Chairman.
All right. How would the board like to handle the agenda?
Mr. Chairman, I move for approval of the agenda as presented.
Second. Any discussion? All those in favor? Aye.
Opposed? No. We'll adopt the agenda as presented.
On the citizen comments, agenda items that are not subject to public hearing. Did anyone sign up?
Mr. Chairman, no one signed up. Thank you, sir.
Consent agenda. How would the board like to handle that?
Mr. Chairman, I would move for approval of the consent agenda as presented.
I heard the motion is our second. Second. Second.
Is there any discussion?
Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Slotter. Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Loftin. Supervisor Dye. Supervisor Trell.
Chair votes aye. The motion carries.
All right.
We'll bring us to board of Supervisor's comments. Are they in?
Hearing none. Any officials?
A selection name for a ball field complex on Stevenson Road.
Who has this one?
Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a motion for the selection of the ball field complex on Stevenson Road to be named Stonewall Park.
So you've heard the motion. It's our second. Second.
Second. It's our discussion.
Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Slotter. Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Loftin. Supervisor Dye. Supervisor Trell.
Chair votes aye. Motion carries.
And the new name of the ball park will be Stonewall Park.
Thank you very much. Certainly appreciate staff's hard work in the commission's advice.
The budget transfers committee business none.
Public hearing, amendment, physical year of 1920 budget.
Mr. Chairman, as I'm sure the board will recall as part of our budget deliberations this past year, the board established a capital fund and a policy whereby
funds in excess of 20% of our budgeted amount would be moved into a capital fund.
For this year, that amount ends up being $4,504,420.
So the public hearing is to authorize the movement of these funds in accordance with the policy and because of the dollar amount, it requires a public hearing.
The points are questions of staff, anyone? All right, this is a public hearing.
Would anyone like to speak concerning this budget amendment to transfer into capital from the general fund? Anyone at all?
Last call. Close the public hearing portion. How would the board like to handle this?
Mr. Chairman, I would make a motion to reflect the general fund and county capital fund supplemental appropriation in the amount of $4,504,520 to represent the general fund fund balance in excess of 20%.
Be transferred to the capital fund.
Second.
And the second, is there any discussion? Anyone? Supervisor Trout?
Aye.
Supervisor Dye.
Supervisor Lofton?
Aye. Supervisor Wells?
Yes. Supervisor Slaughter?
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy?
Aye.
Chair votes aye. And the motion carries.
All right.
Thank you, Miss. In other discussion, landscaping buffers, screening and off-street parking.
Ms. Klein?
Yes. Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the Board of Supervisors.
This is a proposed amendment to Chapter 165, the zoning ordinance, to clean up inconsistencies with certain sections and to clarify or reduce requirements for certain uses.
The zoning ordinance sections amended include storage facilities, self-storage, tractor truck, and tractor trailer truck parking,
rental event facilities, off-street parking and parking lots, landscaping requirements, and buffer and screening requirements.
And I'll walk you through each of those changes.
The first item is storage facilities, self-storage, the proposed changes, correct landscaping and planting inconsistencies regarding plant size in this section with other sections of the zoning ordinance.
And it modifies the requirements for the screening of the use.
For tractor truck and tractor trailer truck parking, the proposed changes prevents the sighting of the above use adjacent to residential uses while enabling the location of these types of facilities where they are most appropriate, i.e. adjacent to major roadways and or in the vicinity of other business and industrial uses.
It also provides a consistent hard surface standard gravel parking that is consistent with the temporary nature of the use.
It also corrects inconsistencies with the section planting requirements with other sections of the zoning ordinance.
For special event facilities, the proposed change provide clarity with certain practices in the county, specifically that the building official with the department of building inspections is responsible for determining if a building or structure existing or to be constructed is agriculturally exempt from the Virginia building code requirements, or if a separate building permit will be required for that structure.
In regards to all street parking and parking lots, the proposed change, correct inconsistencies with the required width of driveways, serving parking lots in this section with other sections of the zoning and subdivision ordinance and the county code, specifically the fire code requirements.
In regards to landscaping requirements, the proposed change corrects inconsistencies with plant size in this section with other sections of the zoning ordinance and further clarifies requirements to prohibit plantings from being located within utility easements and eliminates certain plant species.
Similarly, with regards to our buffer and screening requirements, the proposed change modifies what activities are allowed in the inactive and active distance buffers.
It modifies the landscape screen planting requirements, amends the requirements for buffers with the land to be developed is adjacent to a state road right away with a designated functional classification of interstate arterial or collector roadway and amends what zoning districts are allowed to request a reduced buffer distance.
The development review and regulations committee discussed this item at their July 25th August 22nd and September 26th regular meetings and the committee was generally supportive of those proposed changes.
The planning commission discussed this item on October the 2nd and this item is presented to you all this evening for discussion.
The staff is seeking direction from the board of supervisors as to whether this item is ready to be sent forward to a public hearing and staff is available to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir. Questions, surprise a lot.
Mr. Klein, I know some of the planning commission's comments and my comment also under tractor truck and trailer parking.
They recommended the removal of the temporary nature of the use and I see that is still here.
What do we mean by the temporary nature? Is there a limit on the amount of time that these can be utilized?
There was no, we did not provide a definition for the time frame. The planning commission believed that the inclusion of that statement that the use is maybe temporary was too inexact and should be removed from the text amendment.
So that's what we did with it.
It's just not contributing anything to the ordinance and we should do away with it.
And that was removed from the attachment that was included with your packet.
Other questions, anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Klein, the section 165 buffer and screening requirement where we're striking through active buffer should not contain rights of way.
What is the thinking behind allowing rights of way versus not allowing them in the active buffer?
Let me just pull that section up.
Sorry, your question was in regards to the active buffer and the inactive section a paragraph two.
The current requirement is that the active buffers will not contain road rights of way but we're striking that.
We already allow other activities in the right away.
We allow parking, driveways for parking, trails and other recreational amenities.
So it was an effort to be consistent with the fact that we're already allowing activities as part of that as part of the active buffer and road rights away are servicing the use but they're not the primary use.
And I think the intent of that section in regards to the inactive and active buffer is to prevent primary use activities from being located within them.
Thank you.
Other questions, Mr. Klein? Supervisor Loff to do another question.
We say the facility should not be located adjacent to residential uses.
Generally, what would be the buffer between the tractor trailer parking and residential uses?
I don't know off the top of my head.
I believe it's a category C type buffer but there is a significant distance between business and industrial uses and adjacent residential uses anywhere from 50 to 200 feet depending on the type of screening that is provided.
I just think there may be another zoning use in between the residential under tractor trailer parking but it could be just buffers that separate residential from the tractor trailer parking.
No, I believe the intent is that we wouldn't locate tractor trailer truck parking immediately adjacent to a property that was zoned for residential, whether that's a rural piece of property that has an existing residential use or property that is zoned for residential uses.
If this is enacted, it's a future look at this. It doesn't affect any existing facilities like this because there are some existing facilities like this.
Correct. It would only apply to new applications for tractor trailer truck parking. It would not retroactively impose a standard on those that already exist, that already exist.
I think the only thought to giving make it a paid surface even if it's prime and seal or a tarantium of some people call it as opposed to gravel surfaces because the weight of those tractors and trailers and trucks seem to take gravel to dirt real fast.
So the current standard is a hard surface. In this case it'd be asphalt or concrete given that the use is considered a temporary or interim type use where there may be tractor tractor trailer parking now but in the future a higher and better use may locate on that site, installing a temporary surface such as gravel was easier to clear the site for permanent use as opposed to tearing up asphalt or concrete.
And as I understand it from some of the operators of tractor trailer truck parking facilities, asphalt services are susceptible to the tractor wheels and legs sinking in when it's very hot so they'd have to do a concrete surface as opposed to asphalt and there's an expense there.
Okay, thank you.
Other questions? Supervisor Don.
Mr. Klein, in the conversation I had with my friend earlier, my impression was that you would not have this type of parking adjacent to a residential facility or maybe I had the conversation with you, I'm not quite sure.
But with Mr. Lofton's comment, you're applying that adjacent. I thought it was not adjacent.
It was about existing tractor trailer truck parking facilities that may already be adjacent to a residential use.
But the purpose of this amendment is to prohibit that in the future so that they would not be located adjacent to a residential use.
So the follow-up question is that as Mr. Lofton said, what type of designation, if you will, is between a residential use and this, is there a designation that is defined?
It would be prohibited. Currently, we require a type of buffer, depending on what the zoning of the site where it's being located is versus the residential use.
But that would, with a different buffer, with a different land designation.
I'm asking this is a question.
I don't, my apologies. I don't understand your question necessarily.
Let me try. I mean, it's only an allowed use in B3OMM1 M2 zoning districts.
Okay.
Which can't be, I mean, it's not that it can't be adjacent to residential, but the buffers have to be in place.
Distance and plantings.
All right. According to the table that's in the ordinance, does that help?
Thank you.
Further questions? Anyone?
Just one.
On page seven of seven.
Under six. Paragraph C.
And the ordinance.
Trees minimum six feet.
And eight feet center to center. Doesn't seem to be consistent with the changes and other paragraphs earlier on in that section.
And the verbiage is not consistent either.
Was that supposed to be four and 12?
I believe you are correct, sir. When we formatted the changes that were proposed by applicant, I believe that might,
the four feet and 12 feet, but the changes might not have carried over.
So we will make sure that that amendment is included when it goes to public.
I want to look at the verbiage description of feet center to center or what you used earlier.
Just for consistency.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Further questions, anyone?
So the question is, is it ready to go forward to public hearing?
Mr. Chairman, I have a move that we move this on to public hearing.
I'll adopt the resolution.
I'm forwarded.
Thank you.
Resolution forward to public hearing.
Herd the motion is our second.
Second.
Second.
Any further discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed now.
We'll forward that one to public hearing.
It brings us to 12b.
Telecommunication.
Yes, sir.
This is also an ordinance amendment discussion.
And the purpose of the proposed amendment to chapter 165 of the zoning ordinance is to enable smaller commercial telecommunication facilities in certain zoning districts by right.
To codify changes enacted by state code, creating a two track process for the approval of telecommunication facilities, and to enable communication facilities by right.
And the OM Office and Manufacturing and H.E. higher education zoning districts.
The changes to the telecommunication facilities section are wholesale and includes new definitions and changes to the additional regulations for specific uses outlined in 165-204-19.
The two track process enables administrative review eligible projects.
These are small cell facilities structures under 50 feet in height or co-location on existing telecommunication structures.
And these administrative review eligible projects would be permitted in all zoning districts.
And they would be reviewed administratively by staff.
It also creates a standard process projects.
These are the ones you all are currently familiar with, which is going to be your telecommunication monopoles and towers in excess of 50 feet.
And these would continue to be reviewed under the conditional use permit process, which would require public hearings before the planning commission and the board of supervisor before they could be approved and cited.
This item was proposed by the county attorney and staff, and the development review and regulations committee discussed this item at their September 25th regular meeting, and the DRC was supportive of the proposed changes.
The planning commission also discussed this item on October the 2nd, and this item is presented to you all this evening for discussion.
The staff is seeking direction from the board of supervisors as to whether this item is ready to be sent forward to a public hearing.
And staff is available to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you, sir.
Questions of Mr. Klein, anyone?
Mr. Klein.
Mr. Klein.
Mr. Klein.
I had a conversation with Mr. Williams, and I just want to make sure that the by-right is required by state law, and that's making a consistent with state law.
Correct, Mr. Williams?
That is correct.
Therefore, the county cannot really change that by-right. That's part of this overview.
Correct.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor McCarty.
Thank you, Chairman.
Mr. Klein.
This, I think, was brought to the county attorney's attention by supervisor Lofton and myself as one of the things that we really wanted to see to aid those out in our areas of the county.
I applaud you for coming up with this.
I've been talking with a couple of the WISP providers in the area.
One of the main concerns is that a 50-foot pole may not be tall enough in areas like Gainesboro and Back Creek, where we have hollows and mountains and that type of thing and tall trees that can be over 50 feet tall.
Have we looked at any other localities like Clark County that recently passed a similar ordinance to see how they've dealt with those things?
I do not figure at this point I'd give you the base ordinance and obviously if the board wants that explored further and ultimately decides to wants to look at a larger number that would be the board's prerogative, we can certainly look.
Okay. So there wasn't anything that caused you to say, let's not do that.
This was the state law.
Okay, basically.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Other questions? Supervisor Lofton?
To follow up on Supervisor McCarthy's comments there in questions.
I too have been talking to some of the WISP providers and our providers.
I don't know the 50 feet.
The 50 feet is a...
Can the county exceed that 50 feet if we so desire?
The county can enable any height it wants.
It has to allow the minimum of 50 but if the county decides the board decides that it wants it to be 2000 then that's the board's prerogative.
Okay, because I think running over in between.
I like this change because I think it helps us but I don't believe it's going to help us enough to get the broadband and internet service to this under an unserved areas in the county the way it's currently structured.
But thank Mr. Williams for taking the opportunity to bring it up to speed and bring us in compliance.
Potential compliance with the state but I think there's going to have to be some changes made here but I'd like to go to public care so we can get some more input on this and I'll continue talking to others in that field to find out exactly what.
The biggest thing I'm hearing is trees and trees can grow to 80 feet tall so 50 feet unless you've got a specific band.
Frequency that you can use is it's going to make it tough to help expand their broadband services out there but I'm okay letting it go to public care and I think we do a little more input on this.
Thank you for your work on this.
I might just comment that it's not that they can't go larger they're just going to have to do this use the C CUP process.
I mean I understand what your concern is and don't disagree.
They can still go larger this have to use the CUP process.
Right but I'd like to see if we couldn't somewhere between.
Yes.
Get us a little closer to without having going to CUP.
Mr. President.
On the high issue.
I'm probably more comfortable with a 50 feet with the option going higher or in case by case basis in a more densely area.
A 2000 foot example being appropriate in a rural area might be appropriate so I'd probably be more interested in something on the 50 foot line as a mandated with the option to go higher or in case by case basis.
And I'd also like to make certain that citizens that are affected by this have the opportunity to come here.
I'd like to hear the input from people that are directly affected and if the press can go and you know and you know advertised that there's going to be public hearing of planning commission public hearing here.
So we can get that input or contacting us individually that would be helpful in the fall process.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Other comments?
More of a question to the county attorney.
Can this board designate certain areas of the county with different height requirements?
So you know in the east side where it's less mountainous you may not want to have as high.
Absolutely certainly would need something to think a little bit higher than the 50 feet.
Okay that's helpful.
If you're using existing zoning districts or you could use geographic areas obviously if you use geographic areas then there's the challenge of defining them.
Just say interstate 81 east west whatever.
Okay thank you.
Other questions or comments?
Anyone?
Are we ready to send it forward?
It's not ready to.
Thank you.
Motion to adopt the resolution to send it forward to public hearing is our second.

One no?
We'll send it forward to public hearing.
All right.
That'll bring us to board liaison reports are there any?
Hearing none this is the opportunity that we reserve for citizens to comment on any issue they might like to bring before the board.
Anyone like to comment any subject?
Anyone?
Seeing no one we'll close the citizen comment portion board of supervisors comments are there any?
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor done.
I have three comments to make one in Greenwood.
There's a convenience store that was considered to be the best convenience store in the county.
Greenwood convenience at Shenandoah at Sensitane Greenwood.
So congratulations to the owners of that operation.
And secondly we've talked a lot about education.
In the last month we've found out that the school board has or the all the schools in particular have been accredited.
So Dr. Savine, good job.
In addition, my school graduation rate has been exceptionally high.
Same situation to the school teachers.
Good job.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
