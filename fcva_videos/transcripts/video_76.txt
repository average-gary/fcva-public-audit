Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have seven p.m., so I'll call the meeting to order.
Supervisor Stagmar, would you lead us an invocation, please, sir?
We bow our heads in prayer.
God Almighty, these are difficult times when we, as Americans, come to seek your guidance
and encouragement.
In your wisdom, you have taught us that without a vision, we, the people, will perish.
Lord, our nation's roots and foundations, including our Constitution and our national
history, are being challenged.
We pray in these perilous times to be recommitted to the vision of our nation and state and
our community, as e pluribus unum, out of many one people, and that we will work out of
that vision of one nation under God and one community under your guidance and protection.
We pray that this resurrected vision will allow us to see a promising future for us all,
encouraging each of us to use the gifts, talents, and sense of right and wrong which you have
given us.
As we approach our celebration of the birthday of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
this Monday, may we be moved by the Holy Spirit to share the common American dream that
he spoke so eloquently about, to work on contributing our talents, our compassion, and
our moral compass to unite us as Americans in our strong national character, rather than
to be divided by superficial differences, such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
In your holy and precious name, we pray, amen.
Amen.
Thank you, sir.
Please turn the bells.
He leads the flag.
Please, please, face the flag.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
it stands under God and the Muslim, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you, sir.
I'm number four, the organization of the board for 2021, the election of a vice chair.
I would the board like to handle this.
Mr. Chairman?
Yes.
I'd like to nominate Mr. Douglas McCarthy as vice chairman.
Great, sir.
Further nominations?
The chairman, I would like to nominate Mr. Robert Bells.
All right, sir.
Further nominations, anyone?
All right.
Figure a way to proceed.
So why don't we just go down the row and select one?
Is that work for everyone?
Supervisor Stagmar.
Vice chair.
I heard the one that you would...
Oh, I said name the person.
I got you.
Got you.
Yes.
Supervisor Wells.
Thank you, sir.
Supervisor McCarthy?
Supervisor McCarthy.
Outstanding choice.
Supervisor Slotter?
Supervisor Wells.
Thank you.
Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Wells.
Excellent choice again.
Supervisor Dunn.
Mr. McCarthy.
Thank you, sir.
Supervisor Grave.
Mr. McCarthy.
Thank you, sir.
Chair will have to vote for Supervisor Wells.
So Supervisor Wells will be our vice chairman again for 2021.
Adoption rules of procedure.
How would the board like to handle that one?
Mr. Chairman, I would move that the board adopt the rules of procedures originally adopted by the Frederick County Board of Supervisors on May 28th, 2003, and amended July 8th, 2020,
with the addition of Section 1-12, the remote meeting participation policy originally adopted by the Board of Supervisors on March 25th, 2020.
I further move that the board adopt Robert's rules of order, simplified, and applied.
Second.
Motion in a second.
Is there any discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed?
No.
We'll adopt them as presented.
Selection of a parliamentarian has traditionally been our county administrator.
How would the board like to handle this?
Mr. Chairman, I would move that the board elect the county administrator as parliamentarian.
Second.
Second.
Is there any discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed? No.
No.
Do we know?
County administrator will be our new parliamentarians.
Selection of time place for the regular meetings.
Mr. Chairman, I would move that the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month at 7 p.m. in the Board of Supervisors meeting room.
County administration building 107 North Kent Street.
Winchester, Virginia, be the time and meeting place for the Frederick County Board of Supervisors for 2021.
With the exception that the second meeting in November and December not be scheduled because there's a conflict with the holidays.
I further move that should a meeting be canceled due to inclement weather.
It will take place on the following evening.
Second.
Second.
Any discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Opposed? No.
So adopted.
Chairman's annual committee assignments and citizen member assignments.
I will get those distributed in the next few days, hopefully.
Organizational and motions.
I think that that is taken care of adoption of the agenda.
How would the board like to treat the agenda?
I would move to amend this motion to add to the agenda item 9D.
Which would be under county official authorization for the county administrator to execute contracts with EF Johnson slash JVC Kenwood and mission critical partners for the procurement of a public safety radio system and related services.
On the public safety video commission staff working group finalizing those negotiations with EF Johnson JVC Kenwood and mission critical partners of contacts for the public safety video system and related services.
All right.
So you have the motion to adopt the agenda with the amendment of adding item 9D.
Is there a second?
Second.
Mr. Chairman.
And a second.
Is there a discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
So you've proposed or done?
So Mr. Wells, this is not part of the consent agenda.
This is a separate standalone.
No discussion.
Is that correct?
That's correct.
Okay.
Thank you.
Yes.
All the comments?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Supervisor Kurt.
I mean, I'm sorry.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
This motion was made at a prior meeting and we postponed it for or was on an agenda of a prior meeting.
We postponed it for staff to take a look at some questions that we had.
And I believe this body unanimously consented to have those things and looked into.
And as far as I know, those things haven't occurred yet.
In addition, the policy of this board is that if something is to go on the agenda that has to be submitted prior and the
week prior so that it can be on the agenda and considered by the members before they arrive at the meeting and have but 10 or 15 minutes to think it
through before we have to vote on it.
So I will pose adding it for that reason.
This is a $30 million project that we're considering to add it to the agenda.
I think it's an appropriate.
Thirdly, I would say that on the agenda this evening, we had a proposed closed session to discuss some events surrounding this proposal.
And three of the supervisors that sit behind this desk requested that meeting.
Three of the supervisors who represent one half of all of the citizens of Frederick County asked to have a discussion with our county attorney relative to information that we received.
So I would say that with regard to some legal challenges that were communicated to the attorney.
And we showed up at four o'clock. Many of us took off time from work to be here at four o'clock to take food out of the mouth for our children so that we could be here to serve our community.
And we weren't given the courtesy of being able to go into the closed session to represent our constituents to have those questions answered to have that discussion.
I would like to discuss with all of us in the same room with the county attorney in the three years, three and a half years I've been on the board.
Not once. I'm proud to say have ever voted against allowing any member of our board to discuss a concern that they had.
Not once have I ever intentionally missed a meeting, even when I had other things that I'd already made up my mind on some things, but I still came and I listened and I sat and I listened to what you all had to say.
And I'm disappointed. It seems to me that this country has come to a point where people make up their minds. They don't care what anyone has to say.
They don't want to hear the other side. And whether you agree with them or not, let's at least sit down and talk to each other and hear each other out.
You may not like what they have to say. You may not even like the way they say it. But at least let's talk because we're all elected to represent the constituents in our community.
And when you box us out and you don't allow us to have the discussion, this is the third time in one year where at least three members of this body who represent 50% of the citizens of this county have asked to have the courtesy of an executive session so that we can discuss something that we can't discuss in public because it's a legal matter.
We're boxed out and our voices are silenced and so are our constituents.
I'm disappointed to say that we all showed up here this afternoon with this one agenda and four of you voted to not allow that conversation to happen.
I will vote against this being on the agenda. Mr. Wells, I think it's inappropriate and it's unfair.
The comments, anyone? Mr. Chairman. Supervisor Graber.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would concur with Supervisor McCarthy's comments.
I think my district would be one of would be the only district in this whole entire radio system that has a possibility of being disenfranchised by a system not being the same as the remainder of the system.
One part of the system could be analog, which would affect my residence and the other part of the system could be digital to not have the opportunity to have discussion to have the threats made to this board that we received is and not have the opportunity to discuss it is, as was mentioned, very distasteful.
I do believe as Mr. McCarthy has stated that we should allow this committee to still address the questions that were brought forward.
I still have some questions that I would like answered by the committee and I believe as Mr. McCarthy mentioned that there was agreement by this board that the committee would meet the communications committees what I'm speaking of and address those questions.
So I would appreciate the common courtesy and respect of, as was stated, half of the county residents to have the opportunity to have a look at those concerns and have answers prior to a vote. Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Further discussion, anyone? Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. Supervisor Doug.
A year ago, I know we're starting a new situation, but a year ago, you had requested that any new information be done by Wednesday on the preceding week.
As Mr. McCarthy said, this is a new piece of information. I think that everyone should have the opportunity to know this on the agenda. The public needs to know this on the agenda.
This is inappropriate to go and be put on at this point in time. The committee was meant to go back and look for some further information. That's not been done to the best of my knowledge.
If this passes, then I'll make some comments at that time. If this does not pass, then I'll make some comments during supervisor comments. But thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is wrong.
Sir, further discussion, anyone? I'm going to accept a motion. Is there any further discussion?
Supervisor Grover. No. Supervisor Doug. No. Supervisor Wells.
Aye. Supervisor Slotter. Aye. Supervisor McCarthy. No. Supervisor Stagmar. Aye.
Chair votes aye in the motion carries. That will bring us to citizen comments, agenda items. Did anyone sign up, Mr?
No, sir. No sign up.
Consent agenda. How would the board like to handle a consent agenda?
Chairman, I would move for approval of the consent agenda as presented.
This is our second. Consent agenda, second.
That's second, Mr. Chairman.
Discussion, anyone? All those in favor, aye?
Aye. Opposed, no? No.
Dolly noted.
Roll call because there's money involved. My fault.
Thank you, sir.
Option of the consent agenda. Supervisor Graber. No. No. Supervisor Doug. Aye.
Supervisor Wells. Aye. Supervisor Slotter. Aye. Supervisor McCarthy. Aye.
Supervisor Stagmar. Aye. Chair votes aye in the motion carries. One day.
All right. We'll adopt the consent agenda as presented. Board of Supervisors, comments, are there any?
Chairman. Supervisor McCart. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Two comments. One. I mentioned earlier at our joint EDA or a supervisor's meeting that currently the Department of Labor and Industry has announced a draft permanent standard relative to industries, safety protocols for mitigation of COVID.
In July, I believe it was July 27th of 2020, the original protocols went into place and these are measures that industries are required to take so it's sort of like OSHA, but in Virginia.
These protocols in June, I'm sorry, January 27th, the Department of Labor and Industry want to make what was a temporary protocol become a permanent protocol despite the fact that vaccines are now being administered and we're hopefully moving in a better direction than we have been up to this point.
Many business owners in the community have contacted me personally and expressed concern with this or EDA expressed concern with this that it doesn't make sense to have the idea that this may not be a permanent pandemic.
But yet have permanent regulations that would burden businesses and the employees who work in those businesses, especially in light of the fact that CDC information can you continues to change.
And this OSHA regulation or the Virginia version of the OSHA regulation would not allow for us to adjust to meet what the CDC regulations may have from time to time.
It seems to be an unnecessary step to take. We could do another six months or 12 month temporary policy, but it seems that the governor is intent on moving it forward and making it permanent.
The thing that disturbs me the most is anyone that's interested in going and looking at the regulation, it's the Virginia Occupational Safety and Health Program Virginia Department of Labor and Industry proposed regulation for infectious disease prevention of the SARS COVID-2 virus that causes COVID-19.
The thing that's really disturbing is the tradition in Virginia is that whenever a regulation is passed, administrative regulation is passed, the public has the opportunity to comment on the regulation.
And anytime a change or an amendment or an extension of a regulation is passed, that the public has time to comment publicly on the regulation so that our government can hear from the people.
And as supervisor Stegmeyer said, the people are the government. We are supposed to be a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, all the people.
And this regulation proposed actually has lines striking through the clause that would require public comment to be had before there's an amendment or an extension of this, which means that our government by Fiat can decide that they're going to impose additional regulations upon the people without the input of the people.
The contrary to the tradition of this country is contrary to common sense. I will be preparing a letter to be sent to our governor. I would ask that each of you sign off on that with me.
This goes into effect on January 27th. Unfortunately, our next meeting isn't until January 27th, so it will be a few hours too late to pass a resolution to stop it. But I think I will still bring forward a resolution in monitoring our government for taking this step.
I'm asking them to rescind it and make it a temporary order rather than a permanent order. I would encourage you all to support me on that.
And if you have business owners in your districts that would like to join us in that, I would encourage them to contact me. I'd be happy to make as many signature pages as we need to add to that letter to go down to Governor Northam sometime next week.
That's my first supervisor comment. My second supervisor comment.
I had a very productive meeting yesterday with the new president of the NAACP, Michael Fazon. We had a discussion regarding the Juneteenth question as far as whether we should be celebrating that as a holiday.
That's Michael if he could assist me in putting together a town hall meeting that I'd like to invite all of you to as soon as I have a date to discuss and get everyone's perspective.
Contrary to what this board did tonight, I think the more we discuss things and the more we have conversations as a community and as a group, the better the decisions are for all of us.
I want to encourage us to have a robust discussion about this topic. I want to encourage us not to continue this third shutting down of the three minority members of this board apparently to represent 50% of all of the citizens of this county.
It may take an hour out of your day and you may not like what we have to say. I don't necessarily like to hear what you have to say, but I give you the respect of hearing it.
What government is all about hearing each other out and making the decision after we've heard the other side, not making up our minds before we've heard the discussion, but after.
So I want to thank the NAACP for reaching out to me and helping put this together. I asked my supervisor, the board members, my colleagues to please take a moment to think about the fact that you were elected to represent your folks.
We were elected to represent our folks. At least let's talk it through before you make the decision. I would give you the same opportunity. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
To your first comment, I would encourage you to try it your first opportunity to get that drafted. See if we can get VACO behind it as well prior to the 27.
I'll try to get it out to as many organizations as I can. We'll try to do everything we can to help with that, but VACO could be a big help there.
Just a thought. Other comments, anyone? Mr. Chairman.
I understand that the Department of Education is proposing rules or regulations that basically say that what occurs in classrooms is not going to go and be transmitted to parents.
Parents have the legal obligation to take care of their children whether they're five years old or 18 years old or anything in between.
So I think it's totally inappropriate for the Department of Education to state that comments are made to teachers or others cannot be conveyed back.
If it's an issue of child abuse, then obviously that should be reported to the police authorities and they can deal with that.
If it's an issue if I don't like my mom or don't like my dad or my mom made me pancakes today and I really want to eat something else that's inappropriate.
So I'd encourage the school board, Dr. Zavine, to allow parents who are the legal guardians of children, not to preclude them.
The school is not the parent of the child. Children are parents or the parents of the child.
So that regulation needs to not be included in my opinion in Frederick County.
Second comment.
Like Mr. McCarthy, I've been on this board for five years.
I've listened to all of you speak and some of you that are not here and you listen to me.
And there's a courtesy on that.
And what occurred this afternoon, there was a closed session.
And mostly yesterday and a good portion of the day preparing to lay out some thoughts on that closed session.
And to shut that down is just fundamentally wrong.
We all listen. There's another issue that's going to come up today in which initially I was going to vote one way and now I'm going to vote another way because of comments that have been made.
So we all try to listen.
This is not personal. This is policy driven.
We're talking about a policy of $30 million to shut down a closed session in the future, Mr. Chairman.
If there's going to be four people that do not want it and that's going to be the item.
And just let us know that as opposed to having spent a time in preparation for that.
I'll make comments on the policy issue when it comes up when Mr. Wells brings that up.
But there's a courtesy in saying that if you're not going to have a closed session to just say the votes aren't there.
But to spend yesterday and today preparing for that coming here at three o'clock giving up business.
It is extremely infuriating. So thank you, Mr. Chairman, for reconsidering that.
Thank you, sir. Further comments, anyone?
Hearing none, we'll move on.
County officials presentation of employee of the month, Ms. Dove, if you're here, I hope you are. Would you join us in the front, please?
Thank you.
Employee of the month resolution awarded to BJ Dove.
Whereas BJ Dove is identification of a dependable employee making herself available as a constant reliable resource to all employees at social services.
With the front desk staff counting on BJ to assist when clients come into the lobby or call and staff members relying on BJ to provide assistance and aid with unknown and or difficult case situations.
Whereas our supervisors trust BJ's constancy and help carry load wherever needed and during times of transition and management and BJ has proven to be a sturdy and unwavering leader and an advocate for the entire benefits division.
Whereas BJ possesses a positive attitude and takes responsibility for maintaining morale among workers is thoughtful of other staff celebrating them when the occasion arises and often volunteers to cover the front desk allowing others to attend gatherings.
And where BJ has been a loyal Frederick County employee for almost 20 years and truly cares about the citizens of Frederick County and their well-being as is demonstrated not only through her performance as a social services employee, but also through her actions within the community, such as regularly volunteering with different organizations and innumerous capacities, including the Winchester Area Thermal Shelter,
where she helps serve homeless citizens in a variety of ways. Whereas BJ has been an asset to Frederick County Department of Social Services, especially within the benefits division and her knowledge supportive team oriented and caring nature has added value to the department and to the county as a whole, resulting in her being held in high esteem by her peers who truly and greatly appreciate her efforts.
And therefore be it resolved by the Frederick County Board of Supervisors this 13th day of January 2021. The BJ Dove is hereby recognized as the Frederick County employee of the month for December 2020 and be it further resolved that the Board of Supervisors extends gratitude to BJ Dove for her outstanding performance and dedicated service and wishes her continued success and future endeavors.
And be it finally resolved that BJ Dove is hereby entitled to all the rights and privileges associated with this award. Please join me in thanking and congratulating BJ for her dedication.
Okay.
Okay.
Thank you so much for the opportunity to get to provide you all with an update this evening. My name is David Janino and I also have with me Kyle Rose.
I'm the office of plant industry services program manager with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
And I am the spotted lantern fly crew supervisor for Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
So tonight what we'd like to do is just give you a very high level and brief update on spotted lantern fly status in Virginia. Hopefully you can see that presentation in front of you outlining the multiple life stages of spotted lantern fly.
To get started, I'm going to go ahead and progress. Did that go through all right.
Yes.
Wonderful.
Okay. All right. So I would like to start first just by giving a very brief history of spotted lantern fly in Virginia and its distribution currently.
So a spotted lantern fly is an invasive insect that feeds on a variety of host species. It was first introduced into the United States through Berks County, Pennsylvania in 2014.
Since that time, VDEX inspector staff had been inspecting and serving for this insect for many years to make sure that we were not receiving any shipments out of that area that could have had spotted lantern fly.
And unfortunately, in 2018, we did identify spotted lantern fly in Winchester, Virginia.
This was found on a Alanthus tree, which is also known as tree of heaven in the Winchester and Northern Frederick County area.
The method you see on the right hand side of the screen indicates red triangles. At the end of 2018, that was the distribution of spotted lantern fly positives as indicated by those red triangles.
Since that time, we have been working, we'll get into a lot of details here, but we've been working cooperatively with the USDA and with Virginia Tech citizens and businesses.
But the 2020 update of spotted lantern fly distribution is this picture right here. So we zoomed out a little bit farther and these red diamonds are positives of spotted lantern fly.
So in just three years, we have seen quite an expansion of its population and spotted lantern fly can now be found in Frederick County, Warren County, Clark County, and also Shenandoah.
There's a small isolated population in Augusta County, but we do believe that that was picked up from a hitchhiker.
One insect on a traveling vehicle was found at a rest area.
One thing I'd like to point out before moving on is that if you look at Frederick County as a whole, there are a lot of areas that have yet to be infested with spotted lantern fly.
So as we think about its spread, primarily where it's located are around urban areas.
And the rural spread is happening, and so the threat of spotted lantern fly is shifting where primarily it has been on urban and businesses and industrial, but now we're going to start seeing a shift in its impact to agricultural sectors.
And so into that, I'd like to shift over and hand it over to Kyle to talk about the threat.
So as David said, there are some threats to our community.
One of those is our agriculture community more specifically are apple growers, grape growers, vineyards and wineries.
As you can see in the picture, in high infestation areas, they can overwhelm crop or grower.
Some of the other threats are to businesses through quarantine and permitting, and we'll go into that a little later.
And the next photo you can see that this insect invasive pest is a large nuisance for homeowners and landowners and their properties can be overwhelmed pretty quickly as a high reproductive insect.
One of the other points, which there are many other threats, but we're focusing on kind of some of the bigger ones is the agritourism and the big component in this region and the threat from infestation, as well as applications that go with that can affect that industry.
And so just like the infestation, the pictures, you know, this is where some of the places are heading.
And as the infestation increases, it starts to limit our resources.
And so I'll speak a little bit more about that in the next slide.
So our efforts, the main thing I want to talk to you about is that this effort to deal with spotted lantern fly is cooperative.
There are many agencies, partners, concerned citizens and businesses of which are vital to slowing the spread of spotted lantern fly.
And all of this is right now the cooperation is really good and we're working with USDA and Virginia Cooperative Extension and we're dealing with reports and what happens is we get in at some points a year, hundreds or thousands of reports come into us and our partners.
We follow up with those reports and we go to the property, assess the properties by surveying it and then based on permission from the property owner of business owner.
We may take a variety of actions from a treatment, a trap or actually following up at a later time with other options.
And part of our effort is also permitting and maybe it's going to talk a little bit about permit and quarantine.
Yes, great.
So the next portion talks about the quarantine that's already in existence.
The biggest action that VX took in efforts to limit the spread of spotted lantern fly was establishing the spotted lantern fly quarantine.
This quarantine was established in 2019 by the Commissioner of Agriculture and what the purpose of the quarantine is is it requires businesses that are moving regulated articles out of the quarantine area.
Those businesses need to be permitted and I'll go into what a permit really means.
But the goal, the ultimate goal of the quarantine is to slow the spread.
Natural spread, we really don't have a ton of control over, but if we can identify pathways or areas where the human movement, human assisted movement of this insect, if we can reduce that, whether it's through best management practices or treatments or getting community involvement.
So those kind of contribute to slowing the spread and the quarantine is a tool that contributes to slowing the spread.
So I mentioned permitting this picture here that you see is all of the states where spotted lantern fly is currently known in US.
This was updated on December 7, 2020.
There are a couple of counties that have yet to report their infestations.
But ultimately what this shows is there are several states that have spotted lantern fly.
And then the where you see the red line surrounding certain counties, that's an indication of where a state quarantine has been enacted.
So there's multiple state quarantines.
What we've done is we've tried to harmonize the permitting process that outlines certain steps and certain requirements.
Every state currently that you see listed in that map, they all honor reciprocating permits.
So Pennsylvania has a permit or Virginia has a permit.
Both states are honoring the permit and really helped harmonize the efforts.
What does it take for a business to become permitted?
We tried to streamline this process.
And the permit requires a training, which we had assistance with Virginia Tech.
It teaches businesses about how to identify the insect, how to inspect for the insect records to take biology and best management practices.
Once a business representative takes that training course, then they can bring the training with them, share the information with their staff.
They are required to maintain inspections and training logs.
And then let's say for instance, a business does find spotted lantern fly.
Part of the permit ensures that they are making sure they're taking care of the insect, whether that's with a treatment or scraping egg masses or removing it.
Because ultimately the goal is we don't want spotted lantern fly leaving, right? That's that's the whole purpose.
So I'm going to pass it back over to now Kyle is going to kind of explain at the locality level, what can a locality do?
Thanks David.
So the number one thing that we can all do together is follow best management practices.
And that's whether in a business or at home or, you know, as a, as a community, that's what we need to do.
And, and those can be checking items before you move them.
And then like David said, you find something properly exposing of that adult or nymph or egg mass.
Another thing that can benefit the slowing of spotted lantern fly is working with staff and partners to conduct surveys and do treatments on.
And this is fair amount so that we can get to some of those properties and increase the populations.
Another item is outreach efforts.
So whether it's communicating that with staff and meetings or actually putting materials and mailings to businesses and residents.
These are all key and reminding people of the quarantine and of the insect and how to best manage it.
Like I said, training staff and identification is key to finding them and those early finds identifying them and then killing them.
And then last but not least is it would be, it would be hopefully have a contact person to be able to work with on fines and dealing with the insect in specific properties.
Like David and I both have spoken about the partners in this program are vital.
So definitely want to thank all of the Virginia residents and businesses who supported and been cooperative with the process.
Obviously, USDA, this Virginia cooperative extension and the others.
And this is not a comprehensive list.
There are many, many more partners that help us in this.
I appreciate all of that effort.
With that.
Are there any questions?
I don't have a question, but I really appreciate the presentation.
As all you know, I raised this issue in November because I had a constituent who said, I have a lot of these bugs in my backyard.
What do I do?
Well, Mark Supin and he said, thanks, Blaine.
We get four of these calls a day.
And so it was kind of overwhelmed by it.
So for you to put on this presentation to educate the broader public on what's occurring is important.
And if you remember in the conversation we had earlier, we discussed the fact that I'd go into Pennsylvania for a couple of days from my wife.
And I said, no, I didn't even think about it.
So if you leave and go to those areas that are blue, you might consider checking your car.
It's something that I never even thought about.
Didn't know about until we had this conversation.
But it's something that we have a devastating effect on the agricultural area here in Frederick County, as well as elsewhere in the country.
And so if we can put it stop to this, that's important.
So gentlemen, thank you very much for the time.
And Mark, I hope you get some help for you on this one. Thank you.
Other questions or comments, anyone?
Gentlemen, we certainly thank you and we appreciate all your work.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, we'll end the presentation here. Thank you.
Great. Have a great evening, everyone.
Thanks again.
All right. That'll bring us to nine. Seek.
Okay.

Opposed no.
Mr. Longerbeam reappointed.
Bring us to social services. It's a vacant four year term. It's an at-large seat.
It expires in May.
We have one application. Dr. John Lamana.
I would the board like to handle this one.
I think Mr. Lamana, Dr. Lamana, would do a fantastic job on our social services board.
So I would so move that he fill that vacancy.
Thank you, sir. If hurt in a motion, is there a second?
Second.
Thank you, sir. Is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir. It's a great.
I think this is an absolutely the wrong pick for this position. I'd like to state why.
Social services deal with people who are at their lowest point sometimes in their life.
We need to assure that the folks who are overseeing that board have the highest level of integrity,
have the highest level of commitment to the community.
I have real concerns with selecting this gentleman for the board.
If this board may recall, just a few years ago, Mr. Lamana in the superintendent of schools came before this board
and stated for the pre-education program that no county funds would be utilized only except and maybe, but they were.
The first year there was 250,000, the second year the same.
If this board is told something in confidence expecting that the person telling us we'll be telling us the truth and we'll follow up on what they promised,
I have a hard time appointing someone to a board who has not kept their word previously.
Therefore, I cannot support this gentleman for this seat. Thank you.
Sir, any other discussion? Anyone?
Supervisor Stegmar.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Aye.
Supervisor Slotter.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye.
Supervisor Dunn.
Aye.
Supervisor Graver.
No.
Chair votes aye.
And the motion carries.
Dr. Lamana, be a point.
We're committee appointments.
I think we just took care of that.
That was part of 9C.
That will bring us to 9D, which is.
Motion that.
I'm sorry.
It was the motion to add the.
Yes.
Add it to our agenda.
Would you care to repeat your motion?
Sure.
The motion was under 9D.
That the county officials authorization for county administrator to execute contracts with EF Johnson.
And the JVC Kenwood mission critical partners for the procurement of a public safety radio system.
And related services upon the public safety radio communication staff.
Working group finalizing negotiations and repeat that finalizing negotiations with the EF Johnson and JVC Kenwood and mission critical partners.
Of contracts for the public safety radio system and related services.
That was the addition to.
Yes.
To that.
I would move to authorize the county administrator to execute these contracts with EF Johnson and Kenwood mission critical partners for the procurement of this public safety radio system and related services upon the public safety radio communication.
I would move to the second and finalizing negotiations with them and mission critical partners and contracts for the public safety radio system as related services.
Her dimension is there a second.
Second anyone.
So I want to ask that.
I do have one one issue with it and it should be a contract.
To not exceed.
I don't recall the exact dollar amount, but I think that should be a part of that.
I don't know what to do with it.
Car to head of the horse, I think.
Mr. Chairman?
Yes.
I could put it in a number for you.
I think.
Not to exceed $15 million.
I would second that.
You got ahead of yourselves.
But I retract that.
Second.
Second.
Okay.
Now we're in discussion.
Okay.
So if we're in discussion, the first question I asked Mr. Wells is,
can we separate out the vote on EF Johnson and the vote on mission critical partners?
Mr. Chairman, you're shaking your head and nose.
So I'm asking the question on motion under discussion is stated.
Okay.
All right.
So let me then make some comments to this motion.
For all of you in the audience, we were meant to have had a closed session to discuss this earlier that did not occur.
So to give you some background on what's occurring and why I have some concerns.
First, I am neutral on whether it should be EF Johnson or Motorola or Harris or anybody else.
I really do not care at this point in time.
I have some significant concerns on the RFP and how it's put together.
And that's a major concern.
So let me tell you what my concerns are from a county official on the RFP.
The current motion talks about the fact that there will be 20 DBs and certain areas and 12 DBs elsewhere.
The question that I wanted to ask the communications committee was,
did they consider something lower than 12?
The reason is that's a cost saving issues.
For homes, normal homes like I live in, the chairman lives in, Mr. McCarthy lives in, Mr. Gray lives in.
You only need four to eight DBs to penetrate that home.
So if you're in that house, you're going to a medical issue, you can easily be penetrated.
For buildings such as the one we're in right now, the hospital, you need 20 DBs.
Most of the, so the question is, did the committee go through and discuss how many DBs were necessary to meet the 95% requirement?
And if there were very few, then we could actually lower the cost of this whole project by having a lower number.
If the number were higher, then the 12 DB might be appropriate.
But one of the questions I have is, what's the question asked? And I don't know.
The second question they asked was, in radio systems, you have a 7, 800 megahertz.
There's a very high frequency VHF and an ultra high frequency UHF.
And in this situation here, why was UHF chosen? There's pros and cons on both.
7, 800 is typically a public safety item that doesn't have interference with elsewhere and UHF may.
So the question is, did they go through that thought process and eliminate?
Here's the pros, here's the cons, why or why not.
Third issue is, on the design, Motorola and Harris, both failed on the first initial request for information on the P25.
Motorola was given a second chance to put it in alternative.
Why was Harris not given the same opportunity?
Next question on the 95% issue.
In the southwest corner of this county, there's a national forest, the George Washington National Forest.
Mr. Graver and I spent some time there earlier this week going through that.
If you remove that national forest in which there are no buildings, then the numbers change.
So for example, if I gave you a square of 100 seats and told you that you need 95% coverage, then obviously you need coverage for 95 seats.
But if you remove 5 seats, now your coverage is going up to 100%.
So the question is, did they go through the thought process on coverage for an area that has no buildings?
I hike. If I'm in an area where I know that I have no cell phone service, it's my risk, et cetera.
A couple years ago, there was, or a number of years ago, there was a playing crash in that area.
In that case, you're bringing in other resources.
But that was an issue that I would like to have had and discussed.
EF Johnson has a standalone tower to cover certain contingencies.
So my question to EF Johnson is, what is the cost to integrate that in the whole system that you have?
Harris had a system and Motorola had a system that was integrated.
And this was a standalone, which means you have to switch a switch going into an area in a high stress situation.
Did they think through that pros and cons on that issue?
On the radio concerns, for mission critical, I asked three questions and got three incorrect answers.
The comment on the question was, when I asked Mr. Milis, what about the VP8000?
And he told me that it was in the hands of the chief Lennonberg.
The VP8000 is a portable phone.
It is not in existence today. They have a VP6000.
The upgrade is a hardware and software issue.
In conversations I had with EF Johnson earlier this week, they said that if they build their integrated system,
there is anybody's radio, a Harris radio, EF Johnson radio, Motorola radio, or anybody else's name's mothers.
That's a plus for EF Johnson.
But for Harris to have made the comment to me, and he said, well, have you checked on the website, Mr. Dunn?
That same radio system he's been involved in in two other states.
The second item he made was, when I asked the questions on coverage in the National Forest,
this comment was, we've had a number of instances there.
When I asked Leanna Pyle, his director of our 911 center, how many she said two,
and then she said, if you need more, I need dates and times and places.
The reason I raised that issue is that National Forest is adjacent to a number of other counties.
And so when a 911 call goes in, responders from Freda County may be responding,
but the call did not originate in Freda County and originated maybe in Page County or Warren County,
or one of the less Virginia counties.
That was the issue that I'd like to go on through and explore it some more.
In Fayette County, Georgia, which has a similar system with EF Johnson,
they have not even tested an 8,000, they've tested a 6,000.
So one of the questions that the committee was, did you test the 8,000?
The radio system is going to be different, the antenna is going to be different,
that's what I've been told, was it done?
I don't know, yes or no, but those are the issues that I was trying to deal with.
The other issue is site selection.
The EF Johnson site has two towers on school grounds.
The school board has to vote.
If the school board votes no, then the whole system has to be redesigned.
Missy Neal has said that if it's done within a half a mile, there's no problem.
We have no idea on that.
So one issue is going to be, why do we want to have a vote on this today
when the school board has the potential of upsetting the avocado?
I don't know.
But if they don't know, then the commitments that we made by EF Johnson today
go out the window and have to be renegotiated.
Next comment.
Harris and Motorola lost this contract.
And as we all know, when you lose something, you have sour grips.
And I accept that people making comments may have some grains of thought.
So when they make good constructive comments, I'll listen to those as I'll listen to anybody else.
And I highly suspect that if you had Harris in the mix along with Motorola and EF Johnson,
the price tag would be in a $15 to $16 million range, not the $21 million range or higher.
It helps all of us in Frederick County to put as many competitors into the market.
Let them compete for our benefit to get a high quality system which Mr. Wells wants and so do we.
We have a lower cost.
So those are some major issues with that.
And then with mission critical, this is why I wanted to split this in a second.
I was given incorrect information on the mountains on the forest.
I was given incorrect information on a radio.
And then he also asked EF Johnson, I asked mission critical, can you tell me who in the last ten years,
in which you've been the advisor, who have been the participants, EF Johnson, Harris, Motorola, others.
And the response came back, I can't give you ten years of information and give you five years of information.
In that five years of information out of the listing, there was one Harris project that won.
But it wasn't Harris.
It was a dealer of Harris in Iowa and that dealer headquarters happened to be in that county.
In addition, there were two other Harris proposals that were not even included on the list that I was given.
So therefore, I have significant concerns on mission critical going forward and imploring this when I get inaccurate and incorrect information on this.
And so for that reason, Mr. Chairman, I am going to pose this, but I'm also going to make a motion to go and separate this vote so that the vote will be a separate vote on mission critical
as to implement, as opposed to being included in the motion is stated.
And that's a motion.
Second.
Yeah.
Make a motion to amend.
I made a motion to determine, I'm making a motion to amend.
Okay.
The motion to amend 9D to separate MSD from the rest of the motion.
Any discussion on the proposed amended motion?
Yes sir.
Supervisor McCart.
I agree with the supervisor done that it's appropriate to separate the two because the two aren't integral to one another.
You don't have to have one to implement the other.
I think that's fair to have a discussion on the appropriateness of one contract versus the other contract and take them as separate issues.
And I'll say that the reason I state that is when this process began and common sense with dictate, and I think most of the people in this room, when you make a decision to spend a substantial amount of money.
And you need a consultant to help you decide how to spend that money or you want to talk to someone about how best to approach something.
Talk to people and shop around and say, well, who's the best person to help us do this?
Okay.
Well, this person recommends person A. This person recommends person B. This person recommends person C.
I'm going to talk to all three and decide which one I think is the most capable of helping us.
In this situation, we didn't do that.
We just hired A.
Mission critical.
As supervisor done has stated,
Mission critical has not given us accurate information from their main who I would call a salesman.
He hasn't been a consultant as much as he's tried to sell us on a particular system.
And what he's told us hasn't been accurate.
I don't have faith that the man who can't answer the question simply.
The questions that he's supposed to be the expert on is going to be able to do the best job for us to lead us into implementing one of the most important projects that this county has seen in decades.
I'd like to talk to other people. I'd like to talk to person B in person C and find out.
Do we really have the best person before we just jump forward with the one person who we've talked to and hope that they're going to be the best person to implement this.
It's a $30 million project that is going to cost us.
And we have share of Mill Holland here with his people that need the system.
We've got chief my check back there. His people need the system.
Let's make sure we do it right.
So that's why I think it should be taken up as a separate item.
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor Graywood.
I would concur with both supervisors comments to date.
I was the supervisor that asked our mission critical partners liaison a yes or no question and could not get a yes or no question.
Then I was told that the series 800 radios had been in the fire chiefs hands and that they had been demonstrated to work and that they like them only to find out that it hadn't even been on a production line yet.
I don't know how many folks out here appreciate being told this information, but I for one strongly dislike it.
I think that it is it is critical that we look at what other agencies and there are several in Virginia that provide the same services that mission critical partners provides and give this board an opportunity to decide if there is another company out there that we might trust.
I'm in full agreement.
We need a system that will serve the needs of our first responders as well as our residents and that it needs to be done in an expedited matter.
However, I don't believe that we need to rush into a situation where we rubber stamp or give the contract to oversee the installation of this most critical radio system to a company that has been less truthful with us.
So, therefore, I will support the motion made by Supervisor Dunn.
There is a discussion on the proposed amendment.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
If I could please.
I tried to jot down the motion as I heard it and if I'm not misunderstanding, the motion was to authorize the county attorney or I'm sorry the county administrator to execute contract with the F Johnson.
For the committee to finalize negotiations, I did not hear or take that to mean that we would necessarily be continuing to work with MCP.
I am going to let Mr. Wells confirm the motion that he made.
I think that at least the way I had it worded was to authorize the county administrator to execute contracts with EF Johnson slash JVC Kenwood and Mission Critical.
I miss that about this.
That's the way it was worded they worked to.
I certainly understand the other Supervisors concerns about that and if that can be split, I'm okay with that.
All right, further discussion on the proposed amendment.
As long as it's to the amendment, we're in discussion.
I just had the amounts for Supervisors slaughter for the others, but we can save those for later.
We passed that at the moment.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
Any further discussion on the proposed amendment?
Supervisor Graver.
Aye.
Was there done?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarty.
Aye.
Supervisor Stagmer.
Aye.
Chair votes no.
Motion carries.
We will now consider discussion on the amended motion, which is to separate MSD from the rest of the contract discussed.
Point of order, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Point of order.
We just voted on separating mission critical partners out.
So the vote that we just took was on having mission critical partners out of this voter equation.
And now this vote that we would be taking or we'll be having discussion on will be on whether we are going to approve of the if Johnson contract moving forward or not.
Yes, agree.
If I didn't state it, well, I'm sorry.
I could agree.
Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I'm on that.
This is some fortunes that we're sitting here going through these motions having this discussion.
But I would say it could have all been prevented a year ago after a budget discussion.
I asked the chairman, when are the meetings going to be for this committee?
Because we had been discussing capital costs and a money to come out of the capital reserve fund and asked when are the meetings going to be held because it would be interesting to hear what the discussion was going to entail.
And your comment to me was, we'll let the committee handle that.
You'll have time to ask your questions after they come back with a report.
We were kept out and I respectfully ascended and didn't push you on it.
We were kept out.
Supervisor Graber asked if he could sit on the committee meetings.
He was told by you, no, you can't sit in.
You'll have time to ask your questions after the committee does its work.
Supervisor Dunn asked if he could know when the committee meetings were, because he would like to sit in.
He too was told, don't participate.
Don't ask your questions.
Wait until it's all done.
Then you can ask your questions.
Come to find out months later, Supervisor Slotter and Supervisor Wells were allowed to go to the meetings, ask questions, listen to the discussion.
But the three of us, the same three people, let me finish my comment.
I'm not talking to Supervisor Wells.
The same three people who were boxed out of the discussion earlier today were the three people who weren't allowed to go to those meetings and ask our questions.
Had we been allowed to participate in the same level as the rest of the members of this committee, perhaps our questions could have been answered.
Questions that we all agreed, one meeting ago, were important questions that deserved answers.
And it wasn't until we received a threatening letter from the attorneys for one of these companies, EF Johnson, basically saying, we're going to sue you if you don't give us the contract.
We were on track to have a discussion.
At least that's the way it appeared on the agenda.
And now suddenly, that threat has come across.
We're going to say, oh, well, you're going to sue us.
Well, welcome aboard. You're our new partner in this.
That's how these things are going.
And it's really unfortunate that the citizens of Gainesboro, the citizens of Back Creek, the citizens of Redbud,
didn't have a chance to participate in the process.
And the process is flawed. It's very flawed.
We discovered that as we went through the process.
We haven't had the chance to do our duty as representatives to our constituents.
And I laid at the feet, Mr. Chairman, of you, for having kept us out of this discussion.
And I'm sorry it came to that.
And we had a discussion in earlier days.
I may not have had to say that.
But you have made it impossible for us to represent our constituents.
Thank you, sir.
I'm going to comment very briefly with respect.
I did tell supervisors that their opportunity to make the decisions, ask questions,
decide what to do happens in this body and this room.
If there were supervisors attending those committee meetings, I was unaware of.
The committee had been working for two years.
I still think that my advice was right.
Respect your disagreement with that.
And we will move on.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I attended the meetings. I'm not a member of the committee.
I never was a member of the committee.
And I had no comments to the, as what the committee was discussing.
I want that to be perfectly clear.
The reason that I attended those meetings.
And only a couple of them that I attend.
I am chairman of the public safety.
And as chairman of the public safety, I was asked to attend the meeting.
That's what I attended.
I was not.
And the chairman did not say, Mr. Wilson wants you to attend this meeting.
I know you didn't say that.
I just want to be clear that it wasn't, the chairman wasn't saying,
oh, these two can go and you can't.
He told me the same thing about any questions or any things I had.
Had it come before the board.
They weren't discussed in these committee meetings.
I simply was a liaison.
And supervisor slaughter is one of my committee persons on public safety.
And she did attend a couple of those meetings also as a liaison.
With no input or take away whatever you want to call.
We listened and listened to what they were doing.
That was basically it.
So just clarification.
I'm going to ask the board to focus on the motion that is on the floor.
Mr. We are in discussion.
Discussion of the motion, please.
Supervisor Grave.
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.
I too was told to stay out of it.
January of last year, I asked to be a part of the communications committee
because of my emergency services background of 22 years.
I will never do that again to the residents of Bat Creek.
I apologize.
I gave the chairman of this board the benefit of the doubt.
And I should not have done so.
However, I've asked for several things.
And those questions have yet to be answered.
I feel almost tonight like I'm in the House of Representatives.
And I'm having the chairwoman of the house.
Ram something down my throat without even having the figures out.
One of the things that I wanted to find out tonight was.
How much will the total price of this situation be?
And where is the money coming from to pay for it?
You know, we have some money in the capital in the long term plan to pay about 16 million
according to our finance director called the talk tour.
But this proposed system will cost more than that.
So where are we borrowing the money from?
Another question that I had was as had the IT committee had an opportunity to look at this.
And I called some of the folks on the IT committee and they said no.
That's very concerning to me.
There's not only hardware involved in this system, but there is software.
As you may be well aware in your own home computer software has the ability to have hacks and other things security breaches and many many other items associated with it.
There are some companies who have a very high level of security because of.
The customers in which they have one being our US military.
I still have no surety in the security of the system is proposed.
I had multiple questions I wanted answered there.
Could it be that someone comes in and hacks our system and shuts it down?
And so our emergency services personnel do not have a radio system that is serviceable to them.
Another question I had.
If Motorola can provide a system that is completely digital.
If Johnson states they're going to try to provide a system that's completely digital.
However, if it's not, if they can't get the coverage that they need, that they will for the residents of my district, portion of my district, including my house.
I have a series of systems that is analog then it's no better than the system that I have now.
Not my word from the committee so shake your head what you want.
So if my residents are disenfranchised and having the same service.
Or close to what they have now and not a completely digital system like the rest of the county.
Why would we want to move forward with the system?
We're spending a large volume of money for something and not much better service.
I agree with Mr. McCarthy.
I don't appreciate being bullied and intimidated to sign a contract and it is wrong.
And if this was in my personal house, I would tell him to get off the property and never come back.
Yet we are talking about today giving a contract to that very company.
It baffles my mind.
No discussion.
Two months after we are being presented with the information we're asked to vote on it and the committee took a year.
I'm not sure if this is being allowed to get our questions answered.
This is preposterous.
I will not support this system.
I would definitely want to see a new system in an expeditious manner for our first responders.
It is needed.
How this has been approached.
The system is being presented and how this has been presented.
Has been wrong.
I can't support it.
Thank you.
Further discussion.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Two comments.
A couple comments.
One just for the record.
We all agreed that if something was going to be on the agenda.
You want it to be notified on the Wednesday before noon.
This is coming out at this point.
I'm just thankful.
It's just wrong.
What that means is you have four votes.
They can change anything at any time.
That's just fundamentally wrong.
To the motion.
E. F. Johnson sent a letter to the county.
The letter basically said that the committee made a recommendation to us.
And the way the board should just sign off and approve that recommendation.
And if they did not,
that they threatened to lawsuit.
I'm also on the public safety committee.
But the first time I was allowed to go and start to look at the information was October 31st.
Between October 31st and the middle of December.
Six weeks.
I was asking lots of questions and having a chance to look at this information initially.
Between the middle of November or middle of December now.
It's essentially been a dead time with holidays.
So I'm stunned that we're having this discussion today.
I'm being asked to cast a vote.
And if I have to be asked to cast a vote,
I expect to be able to do my homework.
And that doing my homework means asking questions.
Good, bad, or indifferent.
As I said before, I am neutral on whether it should be.
Motorola.
E. F. Johnson.
Harris or somebody else.
I'm still the process saying was the process to arrive where we are correct.
And Mary Will may be.
I know there are communication people.
But I don't know because I haven't had the chance to chat with you to walk through those things.
And that was important.
As Mr. MacArthur said,
$30 million project.
And if anything changes in this, as I said earlier,
if the school board votes no,
then the project changes.
And if the project changes then legally,
what we're agreeing to today also gets to change.
I find it highly inappropriate that a firm,
if they are confident in their proposal,
would go and threaten a lawsuit.
I am a supervisor.
I'm asked to vote.
I'm asked to do my homework.
I am not asked to rubber stamp the communications committee's work.
They may have done a great job.
And it can have the opportunity to affirm that or not affirm that.
If the communications committee was the sign off,
they could go on from the communications committee to the administrator.
If the administrator said yes or no,
then he would be responsible for the outcome.
But that's not the case.
The administrator is not being held responsible for this outcome.
We are, the seven of us.
And so for them to go and threaten a lawsuit is just totally inappropriate.
And for us, further or not,
to not have the opportunity to ask the questions,
to come to conclusion is also inappropriate.
And for that reason,
the timing of this is just totally wrong.
I'm going to vote against this.
But we need a radio system.
We need a good radio system.
Mr. Wells and I, Mr. Wells made the comment earlier.
He wants a good quality radio system.
So do I.
I want one that works.
I want it works to cross the board.
But if I can get a good quality radio system for $15 million and $16 million versus $21 or $22,
I want that too.
When I go out and buy a pair of jeans,
I'll spend $20.
I'm not going to spend $100.
And we haven't had the opportunity to go in and bring in further competition.
Or force EF Johnson and Motorola to confer the compete.
The people from Motorola said we were never asked a best and final offer.
It was just more information.
And if you're going to go and compete from a county's perspective,
you should be able to say to EF Johnson, what's your best offer?
And then criticize that to see if you can get it lower without hitting quality.
If it comes to a point where you lose quality, then it's fine.
You know what? That's too much.
You should have done the same thing with Motorola.
What's your best offer? What can you do?
And what do you not like about the other competitors?
That way we get to learn and hear the cross-comments between an analysis from a competing company
and what they like or don't like. That's informative.
And Harris should have been given the opportunity to have a compete to be competed
because Motorola failed on their first shot,
and then we're given the second shot.
And it's to benefit all of us.
And I guess people in this category are going to pay $15 million, $20 million or higher.
And we have the opportunity, if we vote this down and continue the negotiations,
to save another $5 or $6 million.
And that is significant.
$5 or $6 million by 50 to 60 school buses, just to put that in perspective.
It buys a whole lot more. So I really encourage you all to rethink your positions
and give us the time to go and work on this more.
Not to have vote tonight. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Further discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman, I've listened to three of the supervisors.
I've heard their comments.
I've worked very hard and very long trying to get this through
with doing the right thing for the county.
And I just, my fear is, is that we are going to procrastinate
and daily, whatever you want to call it.
And we're going to not get there.
We've tried and tried and tried and tried.
My thought was to move ahead, to work with the EF Johnson,
pick one of the ones that we have, pick with them, do the best.
We can't see if we can't work out all the problems as we go along.
It sounds to me like three supervisors want to go back to the board.
I don't know what the legalities of that are.
But at this point, I'm just done with it.
And I withdraw my motion.
And if it falls on its face, it falls on its face.
I withdraw my motion. I'm done with it.
All second.
Further discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
I would just like to say, we have been at this process for two years.
We have chosen the expert employees of all departments that are involved
in public safety radios.
We have two experts from Fire and Rescue that deal with our radio system
on a daily basis.
We have two chosen representatives from the Sheriff's Office that have provided
service to our public safety in that department.
We had two representatives on this committee from the 9-1-1 Dispatch department.
And we had two volunteer fire department people as a part of this communications committee.
These people have worked for two years to get us to this point
and make a recommendation.
And they sat down and identified the parameters that they felt were important
to ensure the safety of their fellow comrades.
I just don't know how much more we ask of someone.
They have done the job.
We asked them to do.
They have spent multiple months and time to get us to a point of a recommendation
to give us 95% coverage.
We have law enforcement people out there and EMS people who have no coverage.
And we continue to push this can down the road.
We have a purchasing officer who has taken us through the procurement process
by code to make sure that we are doing the proper ethical things
in assessing a contract and awarding a contract.
The committee's recommendation to us was to award a contract to EF Johnson.
They were the ones who met all the criteria that was put forth in this RFP
and we have been presented that information.
I just don't know how much longer we put this off and jeopardize the safety of our public safety people
on a daily basis.
That's not concluded, sir.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I would just like to address a few things I've just been recently mentioned.
Yes, we do have a purchasing agent in an agent that negotiates this process.
However, state code says we must have a minimum of two companies competing.
But it doesn't say that we have to have a maximum of two companies competing.
There were four companies in this process.
Only two were allowed to truly compete.
The one company that was allowed to compete was went back to being Motorola
and allowed to readjust their proposal.
However, none of the others were.
I would provide to this board and to all those listening that our staff,
some on our staff, did only the bare minimum and did not truly look out for the best interest of our residents
and the pocketbooks they're in.
I concur with Supervisor Dunn's comments that they're very well may likely be
a system out there that does truly meet our needs for $15 million that can be paid cash for with our current funding.
We are already almost $300 million in debt between combined out of the county schools and Frederick County.
That is a lot of money to repay.
To continue to add debt service to our residents' backs, I think is wrong.
When we can purchase a system likely that would be adequate for our needs for a $15 to $16 million price range.
They're wherein we could pay cash for it.
So I think that we have not done due diligence as a complete board.
I believe that instead of doing the bare minimum of only allowing two companies to truly bid this process
that it should have been opened up to three companies and allow the companies to truly compete.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
I would like to continue with the agenda and continue this if you care to under board comments.
We don't have a motion on board.
Does this make sense to you all?
Every second comment to Mrs. Slotter.
Good right ahead.
Mrs. Slotter.
I know you are a hardworking supervisor.
I respect you for the time that we go on the board together.
Your concerns on the time.
I've just thought the suggestion to you that if we had the opportunity to have another meeting to ask the questions of me,
or representatives of the communications or whatever, that would take care of one issue.
Second issue would be that if you bring back Harrison Wall, let all three compete.
I think you could probably end up with a good answer in a two-month time frame.
So I'm not going to push this down the road forever and ever.
I'm simply going to say, get these questions answered.
And if they can be done in a two-night time frame, I'm just going out of the thought of you.
Don't have to comment, but that was just my thought.
I empathize with your concern about our citizens.
We all do.
But I don't see this as drawing out for another two years.
I think it can be much shorter.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, gentlemen.
All right, so let's move on.
Committee, business, code, and ordinance committee.
Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Supervisor McCarty.
Code, and ordinance committee, unanimously recommends that the three items on the agenda before the public hearing now to move.
Third, the motion is air second.
Second.
Is there any discussion?
Any?
I have one, and that's on the second to a two, which is payments of business licenses incorrect accesses.
Big businesses operate differently than what most of us are used to for it to be two or three banks, even five years later before the air is discovered.
I don't think is unusual.
It is money that they did not owe that they did pay.
I think that that that one is a mistake.
I'm okay with the others.
I just have to comment on that.
It's not our money, even though it was their mistake.
Chairman.
Further discussion.
Yes, sir.
I'm also on the code, and ordinance committee along with Mr. McCarty.
And I think the thought process behind that was that we just wanted to see businesses up to date on whatever was owed.
And so if there's a mistake down the road, then that can be adjusted.
It was just to let companies be, you know, up to state with us when we're doing this.
That didn't help me.
I'm sorry.
With the problem in that these are excess payments where they miscalculated and paid too much.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Unless I'm misreading the ordinance, it's not precluding a big business from getting a refund.
It's simply allowing us to handle small refunds at an administrative level.
Larger refunds over 5,000 would come to this body to be approved.
So it's not sort of taking it away from the Lord, those institutions that just requiring that it basically streamlines the process allows anything under $5,000 to be handled administratively and then anything above that to become before us for a refund.
I can live without them.
All right, further discussion, anyone?
Mr. Graywood.
Aye.
Supervisor Dunn.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Slotter.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Aye.
Supervisor Stegmar.
Aye.
Chair votes aye. Motion carries.
That will bring us to public hearing ordinance pursuant to Virginia code.
Who is presenting?
I will bring us to that.
At your December meeting.
Sorry.
At your December meeting, the board considered a state mandated bonus of $500 that was to be paid to Sheriff's Department and jail employees that were complied funded positions.
That was a state mandate that was to be paid by the end of December.
At that time, staff had prepared a couple different alternative additional proposals for the board's consideration.
The implementation of them got somewhat convoluted.
So what the board decided to do was simply make the mandated payments to those complied funded positions and requested that staff bring something back before March.
So what we have before tonight, I hope, is to fairly simple straightforward alternative proposals.
I hope that all of the two that are in order on your agenda, the first would be a $500 payment to all county employees exclusive of those who have already received that state mandated bonus.
If you were to decide to do that, the cost to the county would be $313,000 and $313,500.
It would cover all county employees that have not received the mandated bonus.
The second alternative is a more narrowly defined class of employees.
This proposal would provide a $500 bonus to only those employees that are classified as high or very high risk employees.
And then once again, who did not already receive the state mandated bonus.
The intent of that wording was to try and address those employees that are in the same class of employment as those that received the mandated bonus.
In addition to our fire and rescue personnel, the cost of that alternative because it is a narrower class of employees would be $122,500 to the county.
There is no reimbursement from the state for either of these two alternatives.
If we were to implement one of the two alternatives either way, the money would have to be appropriated, or I'm sorry, require a general fund transfer out of our operational contingency, the balance of which is currently about 2.6 million.
So that's the alternative proposals that we've brought before you tonight, and it is a public hearing.
And I'm happy to try and answer any questions if there are any questions of Mr. Tierney anyone supervising my car.
And the kind of turning needs to, I don't know if it's a legal question or an administrative question.
But do you, Mr. Tierney, we passed a budget last year that included a COLA increase for employees.
And you have prudently not paid that out this year, but you have the authorization to do that.
So is it still, are you still able, even without authorized, but if the board were to encourage you to give a pay increase of some type through the budget that's already been allocated, could that still happen?
Word could do that. We had hope to reconsider that COLA. I'm sitting here honestly trying to remember whether we took that out of the budget.
That's my recollection is it got cut from the budget.
All is no longer in the budget. I don't believe so now. Thank you.
Questions, anyone?
Yes, sir.
I'll write it wrong. I thought that the COLA was in the budget.
I thought that the administrator, after we passed that budget about a week later said, hey, because of comments concerning COVID, that he just said I'm not going to use that.
Maybe the finance chair knows more, but that's that's why I thought it occurred.
I thought both ways, and I heard our staff say that they're not certain.
Mr. Chairman, I believe the COLA was cut from the budget.
What Mr. Tierney froze or chose not to proceed with that, I guess, when COVID hit or leading into the new budget, were new hires or new positions.
They held for a period of time, but then some of those were since released.
Okay, that sounds like the answer.
We brought those back and yes, the COLA was cut before we adopted the budget.
Okay, good. All right, further questions, anyone?
Seeing none, how would the board like to proceed?
Okay.
Says the public hearing would anyone like to comment concerning these two proposals?
Anyone at all?
Last chance?
Close the public hearing portion.
How would the board like to handle these?
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
I would like to make a motion to approve a monetary bonus of $500 each to all individuals who were as of December 120 employed on a full time basis by the county or by or as the county's constitutional officers or by entities for which the county serves as fiscal agent.
And whose positions are classified as very high exposure risk or high exposure risk according to 16 VAC 25-220 emergency temporary standard for infectious disease prevention,
SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused COVID-19 said bonuses to be payable on a before March 31st, 2021.
Provided, however, that no person who received a bonus pursuant to the ordinance enacted by the board of supervisors on December 9, 2020 shall be eligible for or receive a bonus pursuant to the terms of this ordinance.
Or the motion is there a second?
Chairman is to clarify the motion.
Yes, sir.
Was it that only high and very high classifications would receive the bonus if they haven't already received it?
That is correct.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Second.
Second.
Second.
Second.
Discussion.
Chairman.
Those are done.
This is the second proposal that Mr. Tierney had laid out.
I am very high only.
Okay.
That did not receive the mandate from the government.
Okay.
Make one comment.
I talked to our finance director earlier and I had some concerns in the spring on COVID.
Our expected revenue is not as bad as it was expected to be.
And we still are not out of the woods yet because we still have to have business license revenue come in.
Some other issues that occur in March.
But because right now, Mrs. Sheffler has said that she doesn't see any red flags.
And because of the stresses put on here, I'm likely to I'm in favor of supporting the motion that Mrs. Slaughter did.
We are not out of the woods on the economics, but at least right now we are not in a dire situation.
So based upon the finance director's comments,
I think we have the money to cover this expense.
And therefore I would support it.
Further discussion?
Yes, sir.
Are we the motion is for the expenditure of 313,000?
It's the one twenty two for the very high.
The high and very high exposure.
Okay.
And that was your motion.
Yes, sir.
That is the second and that is the motion that we're discussing.
Is there any further discussion?
I have to comment.
I support this motion.
But it's not right that we don't treat all of our dedicated staff equally.
Mr. Chairman.
I would like to come back with the second motion if we after we entertain this motion.
With the one that's on our table, please.
Yes.
Thank you.
Any further discussion? Are we ready?
Supervisor Graber.
Aye.
Supervisor Dunn?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells?
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter?
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy?
Aye.
Supervisor Stakemar?
Aye.
Chair votes aye.
And the motion carries.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, ma'am.
I would like to make a motion to cover the remainder of the employees who did not receive the mandated
requirements.
I would like to say that the number of employees that we just covered with the high and very high
risk.
Let's see.
And I can read the full ordinance if you would like me to do that.
But it would be the balance so that all employees are covered.
Payment of a monetary bonus of 500 each to all individuals who were as of December 1, 2020,
employed on a full-time basis by the county or by or as the county's constitutional officers
or by entities for which the county serves as fiscal agents said bonuses to be payable on
or before March 31, 2021, provided, however, that no person who received a bonus pursuant
to the ordinance that we just adopted or the ordinance on December 9, 2020 shall be eligible
for a receiver bonus pursuant to the terms of this ordinance.
Our demotion is our second.
Anyone?
I'll second the motion for purposes of discussion.
That will take us into discussion.
Yes, Supervisor McCarthy.
I agree that all of our employees deserve the same respect and dignity for the work they
do because it's all important work.
But I disagree that everyone should be treated equally.
We don't pay everybody the same.
Sheriff Mill Holland's employees.
Jobs tend to be inherently more dangerous than perhaps the treasurer's employees' jobs.
So while I agree that everyone's jobs are important, I don't agree that they should all be treated equally.
The reason we're even having this discussion is because the comp board decided that certain people
that have a higher risk deserve some type of for lack of a better order hazard pay for this pandemic.
And the spirit of that, I think the motion that we just passed does that.
I don't think it's appropriate to give every employee that bonus, especially in the middle of an economic crisis,
a pandemic where the taxpayers are having to bear the brunt of those costs.
I think, you know, I think the taxpayers will be happy to support our law enforcement, our firefighters,
who are putting their lives on the line in the middle of a pandemic where they're in the direct front lines.
But the folks that are in the support, you know, they're, it's difficult, but it's difficult for everybody, including the taxpayers.
And I said that at the last meeting, so I don't think it's appropriate to do it across the board.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Further discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I fully concur with the comments that were just made by Supervisor McCarthy.
I have a real difficult time thinking that I will give the same amount of money to an employee who does not
for lack of a better words, get their hands dirty in person's violence, but other things that really put them at high risk,
are poor folks that wear a badge every day, whether that be fire, any MS, or whether that be law enforcement,
every day, run the risk of getting spat on, punched, all the other items that go along with their, with their job.
To give those employees a 500-hour stipend and then give an employee that's sitting behind a desk, whether job is also vitally important,
it's two levels of risk or exposure.
And to, if I were in the field practicing, I would be very taken aback to know that the person who may come into contact with three or four people a day
in a controlled environment, are going to be getting the exact same amount of money that I'm getting in a completely uncontrolled environment.
I believe it's a smack in the face to our first responders who are putting their families at risk, who are putting themselves at risk,
to move forward such a proposal as has been proposed, therefore I will not support it.
Further discussion, anyone?
I have to comment that this will leave sworn officers without a bonus.
I believe some regional jail officers without a bonus.
I don't think that's right.
So further discussion, anyone?
I have one question.
Irrespective of how this thought occurs, does the administrator have the capability in his salary,
I mean, in the money and salary allocated for salaries, to do anything on his own, or is that totally eliminated?
I'm just asking as a question, because I don't know.
If we removed the salaries from the budget, they're gone.
We'll start on a new budget later this month or early next month.
Just if offer point of clarification.
I'm okay with that.
The bonus at the board voted on to provide to high and very high risk employees covers our jail and sheriff,
and fire and rescue personnel with the exception of perhaps some office personnel and things of that nature week.
All of them, because when I ask, that's not the answer I got, but I trust your answer.
I can't, I can't tell you that.
I can't, I can't.
Well, that was certainly the intent was to cover the vast majority of those high risk positions.
Let's move on and reach a decision point, unless someone has further discussion.
My recollection was the same as yours, and that it did not include one.
Officers, but I.
I don't remember where I saw that or.
The ones that are serving papers and that sort of thing.
So unless there's objection, we have a motion on the floor.
We've had discussion unless someone else has a comment.
If we finish that discussion, we'll move forward.
It can come back if it needs to be.
Are we ready?
Supervisor Stegmar.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Supervisor Slotter.
Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Dunn.
No.
Supervisor Graber.
Yes.
The motion carries and we'll move on.
Board of order.
That motion failed, sir.
No, that's what I meant.
That's not what you said.
I misspoke.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Chair.
No, it failed miserably.
Thank you.
Yes, sir.
One question on this.
If between now and the next board meeting.
The administrator can clarify exactly.
We'll clarify exactly what we said.
Yes.
Then one of us in the majority may come back and address that issue.
Would I like to see that information first?
We'll document it.
I agree.
Okay.
We're good.
Mr. Klein, thank you, sir.
Yes.
Good evening, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the Board of Supervisors.
This is public hearing on a proposed.
Ordinance amendment to chapter 165.
The zoning ordinance to allow backyard chickens and chicken
Coops as a by right use in the RP or residential performance zoning
district.
This request for a zoning ordinance text amendment was initiated
by a citizen through their board of supervisors representative.
Currently, the keeping of chickens is only allowed in the county's
area.
Or a rural areas zoning district.
The proposed amendment would allow single-family detached
lots.
15,000 square feet or approximately 0.34 acres or greater.
Do have up to a maximum of six chickens by right in the RP.
R4 and R5 zoning districts.
The R4 and the R5 are our planned communities.
Our keeping of chickens would still be prohibited in town homes,
duplexes, multifamily buildings, garden apartments,
and single-family detached lots less than 15,000 square feet.
Additional supplemental use regulations for backyard chickens
are also proposed and includes prohibiting the keeping of
guinea fowl and peacocks following setback and building requirements for accessory structures
specifically the coops prohibiting the locating of the coops in the front yard setbacks
and ensuring they are not visible from public or private road rights of way
creating that areas designated for chickens be completely enclosed and there will be no free
ranged chickens providing requirements for secure feed storage and waste management
and a requirement for an application and permit with a fee of $25 be made to Frederick County
prior to the establishment of the use. Also noted on the ordinance is the note at the bottom
of the screen that private covenants and or homeowner associations may further restrict the
keeping of backyard chickens and chicken coops. The planning commission held a public hide
sorry a public hearing on this item on December 17th and they recommended denial.
The item is presented to this body this evening for public hearing and following the public hearing
staff is seeking a decision from the Board of Supervisors on this proposed ordinance amendment
to allow backyard chickens and the RP zoning district as a by-right use.
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir. Questions of Mr. Klein? Anyone?
Thank you, sir.
Is this a public hearing? Would anyone like to comment concerning these proposed ordinance amendments?
Anyone? Mr. Chairman, we have several signed up.
Excellent.
Laurie Logue.
If you could share your name, magisterial district and limits your comments to three minutes or
less, please. And I will note that we had several comments received electronically that were
transmitted to you yesterday and today. Did receive those. Yes. Welcome. Thank you.
I'm like the microphone. I'm just pulling. There you go. Thank you.
Okay. Can you hear me now? Yes. Thank you.
Laurie Logue, Opec and District. Thank you for allowing me to address the Board of Supervisors.
I ask you to consider the following questions before passing the backyard chicken ordinance.
Can the current animal control and planning and zoning personnel handle an increased response
to ordinance violations without additional burden to taxpayers hiring personnel time and money?
Is the landfill or convenience-like capable handling disposal of both animal waste and dead birds?
How will it be monitored? Will this burden taxpayers? Can Frederick County Animal Shelter Handle
abandon chickens because chickens don't longer produce the eggs or because the owner did not
understand the magnitude or care and responsibility will taxpayers be burden for increasing personnel
and building footprint? Yes, this is a personal responsibility like dog ownership. However,
Frederick County requires dogs to be licensed but are all dogs licensed in the county.
Do all dog owners clean up after their pets and are all pets never abandoned at the shelter?
Also, Virginia has had 60 cases of human-samanella infections linked to backyard flocks
as of December the 17th, 2020. What will be the impact on a restaurant, school, or health care
facility if a poultry disease outbreak is a result of a backyard coupon or improperly handling while
working in these establishments? How would a disease outbreak affect the most vulnerable
citizens susceptible to infection like our elderly young and those with a weakened immune system?
Does a local state health department have the resources, personnel time and money to follow up on
an outbreak considering the current COVID situation? Are local veterinarians or local state agencies
capable of handling a poultry disease outbreak like avion flu and who bears responsibility?
How will backyard coops impact adjacent property values when selling property? The purchase of a
home is the largest investment besides your 401k or retirement plan and some citizens count on
this investment as a part of their retirement to take care of them. Will it distract buyers,
reduce property value, and overall, will one magic stereo district be impacted more than
another if the ordinance is adopted in which will be impacted most? I believe passing the backyard
chicken ordinance will result in the county spending more resources monitoring and controlling
the ordinance, which also could negatively impact residential property owners in the community.
Thank you. Thank you.
Laura Pearson.
Welcome. Welcome. I'm Laura Pearson in the OPEC in district. I want to thank you for allowing me
to express my concerns regarding the proposed issue to allow chickens in a residential area.
Excuse me. My first-hand experience, I've lived on a farm during my adolescence age
from three until over 20 years old. I can state that the maintenance and care of chickens is extensive
regardless of the amount that you have. The odors of the chicken increment,
excrement, excuse me, during the summer months is overwhelming and it was bad enough on a farm.
I cannot believe what it would be like during the summer months in a subdivision if it wasn't
taken care of properly. And it would create a bad environment for the surrounding homes.
In addition, animals that you don't want in a subdivision would be attracted to these chickens.
That's a proven item. I'm concerned that if this is allowed, but they have a dress that they
would put a restriction on other animals, but monitoring these chicken coops they would add maybe
other animals like ducks or peacocks, guineas, and that. And in my other concern is what is the
expense to Frederick County to monitor this? And they would have to have someone that would have
to go through the county and find out where these chicken coops are if they don't properly go through
the channels to get the permits. And I think our county expenses and our time is better
spent on stuff that we need in this county, other than chicken coops. And that's all I need.
Thank you. Thank you, ma'am.
Cherry Riley.
Welcome.
Thank you for allowing me to speak and address you tonight. I'm Sherri Riley from the Opec in
District. Three years ago, I was the citizen who brought forward the request to have the ordinance
changed and allow backyard chickens and RP district. I was unsuccessful at that time.
This year, when the pandemic hit, I decided to readress this issue to allow backyard chickens
in residential. I think they're very beneficial. Self-sustainability is key right now with the
pandemic. This provides that people with an opportunity to have some food. I think the
proposed ordinance is very clear, very specific. And I think it's reasonable.
Chickens provide education, recreation, sustainability. And I also revenue for the county
with the permit. And I would really appreciate you guys considering allowing this ordinance to pass.
Thank you. Thank you.
Patty Solenberger.
Welcome. I'm Patty Solenberger from the Shawnee district.
Chairman Dehaven and Board of Supervisors, I thank you for serving our community as you do.
This has been very educational tonight. I thank you for the opportunity also to speak this evening.
I sent an email to Mr. Klein voicing my support for backyard chickens. I found that those who
fear backyard chickens are usually not very knowledgeable about chickens. At one time, the thought
of having chickens in a subdivision was foreign to me as well. After reading up on it and actually
experiencing it, I see it as a win-win for building our community and building community.
Children and adults both get to learn where their food comes from and basic animal
husbandry. And egg is the perfect food. It's ratios of fat, protein, and calories qualify it
as a superfood. We shared our eggs when we had our chickens with our neighbors and many backyard
chicken farmers donate them to local food banks. Another win-win for building our community.
Chickens are territorial for protection. I live near the country club. It's not unusual to see deer,
foxes, skunks, groundhogs, raccoons, possums, and squirrels. Chickens do not bring predators
to subdivisions or communities. The predators are already there. Chickens are quiet unless you
have a rooster. There is no need for a rooster and backyard chicken farming because female chickens
produce eggs without roosters as part of their biological function. Most people don't know that. I
didn't know that. Before I researched chickens, I thought you had to have a rooster for eggs and
that's not true. A rooster is needed for baby chicks. Backyard chicken farmers want eggs. They don't
want baby chicks. Farmers, we had a chicken tractor so it basically was like a wheelbarrow
and it was contained and you could push it all over your yard and that was pretty awesome because
it provided fertilizer for our yard but it also provided pest control. It's a very natural
holistic pest control and fertilizer. The other thing about chickens is you don't have to feed them.
They can eat whatever is in the ground but most backyard chicken farmers take this on as a hobby
and they actually want to buy feed and other goodies for their chickens so this provides businesses
business for our local feed stores which is another win-win for our local economy. I encourage you
to vote yes to this ordinance and support building community and support backyard chicken farming.
Thank you. Thank you. Fred Riley.
Welcome sir. My name is just picking up. There you go. Thank you. Mr. Chairman,
Board of Supervisors. Thank you very much. I'm Fred Riley. I'm a husband of Sherry Riley who
brought this ordinance to the board three years ago and it's been a wait and see type of
opportunity to see what makes a difference when you look at this are having chickens in the
backyard and what I saw out of it was learning what other neighbors see from it and the one
positive that I looked at was the educational portion of seeing how the development of chickens
happen and yes I grew up on a farm had chickens and it's a matter of care and how you take the
manage that certainly it's going to be a challenge but it's something that as you look at this
pandemic that occurred I'm in shortage of food to individuals that we saw last spring I think
this brought an opportunity what we found because we still have chickens but not at our home
at a legal location and we found that those eggs were supplying us at a time when they weren't
available to the market so I support what Sherry has presented to you and I certainly hope you
will consider this as a positive and I guess vote thank you. Thank you sir. Barbara Burrows.
Thank you. Thank you Mr. Chairman members of the board. I'm Barbara Jean Burrows resident of the
peckin district for 37 years I started out in the peckin district on a large farm in the
double churches area where I raised many different breeds of chickens and other birds such as
quail and pheasant I have no no no nice way to say this but birds and the manure stink.
I have been both sides of this problem I have lived in Fredericktown since 2007 due to my health
about seven years ago or so I had an adjoining neighbor get chickens for Easter for their kids
let me tell you my yard stunk so bad I could not even sit outside especially after a
ranger was humid I had to call the zoning inspector and he sent a violation letter they waited
until the last day allowed to get rid of them too. Human nature being what it is I think you're
asking for trouble in their hood war people who want chickens can move to the country we don't
need them in town and I have a lot that qualifies to have chickens and I've already had a problem
with the smell people when they get things like that or do things they put it right up on the
property line away from their house and close to your house um they also don't realize that
even though there's no roosters chickens cluck and carry on and fuss at each other all day
in the same spot it's not like a flock of birds flying through your yard and they're going to
another location they're all they're all day every day they also attract foxes and raccoons which
is a rabies issue um people start to sneak in other animals the people behind me they had the
chickens also had a duck they will go over the allotment even though you've said six they'll get
10 oh nobody's gonna know that they got four more um and I'm gonna say it since I've lived in
county 37 years we do not police our subdivision as well if you're in an older subdivision that
does not have a homeowner's association you've got junk cars you've got other things that are
illegal in this county that this county doesn't do nothing about unless you can call and make a
ruckus about it so there's already a problem with that and then you're gonna add chickens on
top of it you know the people in the older subdivisions don't have a homeowner's association to help
protect them they've only got this proposal and you know it's already it's it's illegal now
the planning commission has recommended it against it and I feel like the NFL you're gonna have
to have a lot of evidence to overturn what's already on the books uh so I'm just telling you from
both ends of the problem and you can't tell me that it's cost effective to raise your own eggs
because I've had the chickens and by the time you build all the building materials and you
go buy your feed and you go buy your feeders and your waters and your whatever and your medicines
and blah blah you can go to the store and buy a dozen eggs for a dollar you know uh
and you don't need to have chickens to know where eggs come from I mean I was raised in Fairfax
county and that's not a rural county but I knew eggs came from birds and I knew a chicken eggs
so you don't need to have chickens to know that and um I'm sorry but I'm just respectfully
requesting you deny this thank you thank you man Shannon Atkinson-Ginneau
welcome pull it back up till it's comfortable height very good thank you
good evening chair and board of supervisors my name is Shannon Atkinson-Ginneau I'm from the
Bat Creek district backyard chickens have been growing in popularity the current pandemic has
only accelerated those trends though the board continues to grapple with this concept many
localities across the country and surrounding jurisdictions have already passed chicken ordinances
some of these areas include those with property values higher than that in Frederick County
it is legal to have chickens and Winchester, Berryville, Boise, Clark County, Front Royal,
Shenandoah County, Steven City, Warren County governing ordinances placed will address
these concerns regarding rodents outside food attracts rodents not chickens that includes
any food left outside dogs cat squirrel deer or even bird food additional items attracting
rodents includes outside trash recyclables poorly escaping maintenance dirty grills compost and
firewood worried about odor google this a dog produces over 255 pounds of poop per year a hand
produces only 45 that's over five times more than your chicken as far as noise restrict roosters
though it's the neighbors dog barking throughout the night resulting in more complaints than a
chickens clock decreased property values any poorly maintenance house or yard influences
neighboring property values with rising interests in backyard chickens some may prefer to buy a
house where chickens are allowed establish enclosure regulations do not permit birds to run at large
but I bet more than once you've annoyed or found yourself annoyed with the neighbors cat prints
on the hood or windshield of your car afraid of disease to provide some perspective Frederick
County's population is greater than 92,000 as of December last year a month ago a total of
17122 people from all 50 states reported being infected with salmonella 576 of those reported
having contact with chickens and ducklings enforcement would fall under the animal control
division as with any other complaints and concerns a task force of citizens and county staff
can be created to develop an ordinance that will keep within communities values I strongly encourage
you to pass an ordinance with guidelines allowing backyard chickens thank you thank you
that's all we have signed up mr chairman did anyone else wish to address this proposed ordinance
change anyone at all seeing no one will close the public comment portion how would the board like to
handle this one Jim supervise McCart I would move for adoption of the ordinances written
motion to adopt the ordinances presented is there a second anyone I'm sorry sorry your
motion will die for lack of a second I understand mr chairman yes sir I'd like to make a motion
that we adopt the motion as it has been presented with this change that the area of land be a
minimum of one acre instead of the point three four acres that has been proposed to allow for
proper management of said chickens second ocean in a second to approve with the amendment of
it one acre as opposed to 15,000 square feet is that accurate that's correct thank you sir second
curves thank you discussion anyone yes sir you should arise or die I didn't get elected to deal
with chickens I don't think any of us did so mr. Wells you know bringing this forward is an issue
but I want to make a couple comments one one of the constituents for you know packing you raised
the issue with mr. Wells he was gracious enough to say you know what I'm gonna give you a chance
to see what happens and go from there so mr. Wells I think on behalf of your constituents you're
serving them well even though it's one person asking second comment when you made those comments mr. Wells
the constituent of mine in redbud said plain done you aren't supporting it how dumb are you
you're terrible I'll never vote for you again essentially that was there and here's the point
all of us try to go and listen to the data and analyze and when I heard mr. Wells made the
comment all I wanted to do is say fine I'm gonna listen to the pros and the cons I'll make the best
decision I can with that data and so when people go automatically say well done you know you're
stopped stupid and some of you may agree with that it's fine but we go through an analytical process
and in that analytical process I have some conversations with our county attorney mr. Williams
and here are my concerns on the project that is being laid out
if we adopt this today even with this amendment and if in a year or so we say no it's a
bad situation everything that's occurred has been grandfathered my parents had chickens in a
suburban area when my mom was a kid she remembers taking chickens taking their heads off and going
from there I wasn't around but today because of some of the concerns that were raised I'm not
prepared to go and support this um as written I was hoping that we could have a pilot program
and I would have supported a pilot program for a year to see what could occur see whether
the good stuff bad stuff etc. According to our attorney if you have chickens and you
enclosed it you cannot go and inspect so I've seen two good comments both pro and common one
was a letter from a woman in stone while I believe the other was given here by the last speaker
who made opposite comments my problem with the comments is we could not go into a home and say
fine we have ten tons of chicken poop cleaned it up we can't go in the home and say fine do you
have four chickens eight chickens or two quails and so for those reasons I'm just I can't support
this without a pilot program and without some type of a time limit um if it comes back to later time
some restrictions I might but I can't do it today but mr. Wells on behalf of your constituents
I think they should thank you for bringing it up um and we all try to analyze so I appreciate it thank
you thank you brother discussion anyone mr. Chairman yes I realize that the the motion now is is for
it to be changed to an acre is that correct that's correct um so in a sense uh for me representing
the Shawnee district it it's not as much of an issue uh for for the vast majority of my
constituents the the challenge that I I have is understanding both sides of this new issue for me
and then communicating with my constituents about it in such a way that they have some input
but that has yet uh that has not been provided to me because I'm new on the board if I'd been here
for the last two years it might have been different but I I just feel at this point that uh I need
to check back with the people that I represent and for that reason I will object even to the the
amended motion thank you further discussion to the motion yes sir most everybody was from over
in district and uh and that's my district um I've talked with with all the board members
in them talking with planning and and so forth uh really was hoping and I thought up until
this evening really that this could be a pilot program a one-year pilot program uh and I was in
favor of that even with the lesser acreage uh one one acre would be even better but I found out
that that's not possible uh Mr. Don's supervisor Don and I talked about that um
and so and then the planning commission uh meeting uh they don't pass it and that's my group
my go-to group of fellows and ladies that say this is what you know we're bringing to you and
and think you should do uh so I have a hard time I really wish that we could come up with something
and maybe we can later on uh but right now at the present time um I'm hard pressed to do it because
it's uh a final and rather than a one-year opportunity and I know Mr. Don came to me and said
maybe we could do it for one year in your district and I said maybe we could do it for one year in
your district and the law does not allow it to occur in either district all right we had a good
chuckle over there please that's why I'm having a difficult time please we are covered on our public
hearing requirement Mr. Williams uh yes I thought we were but just one to check so any further
discussion on the motion chairman yes sir supervise my car I completely understand the nervousness
and the reticence about implementing something like this but I do look at the fact this isn't a
novel idea there are hundreds if not thousands of communities in this country there are thousands
of communities in Europe that have the ability to keep a chicken in an area much smaller than what
we're proposing here and it works and it really ultimately comes down to responsibility the same
person who doesn't take care of a chicken isn't going to take care of their dog isn't going to
take care of their cat and I've lived next to in a townhouse next to a family who let the dog
just go outside every day and the family never went outside and the piles piled up and piled up
and it can become just as much of a nuisance as the chickens so I know that there's a lot of mythology
and a lot of fear about chickens and as someone who has chickens there's a big difference between
keeping 20,000 chickens cooped up inside of a hoop house with blowers and the sun never shining
versus six chickens on an acre of property in the grass where nature takes effect and keeps
the smell away and all of that I think it's a reasonable I think Mr. Graber's amendment is reasonable
and anyone who's raised backyard chickens knows that it's not the same as going on a farm and
trudging through knee deep feces within one of those hoop houses that have 200,000 chickens crammed
into it as far as like the disease and things like that there are studies multiple studies that have
been done that show that backyard flocks have much lower incidence of salmonella than the one
dollar egg doesn't eggs you'll buy the grocery store you have a much greater chance of getting sick
buying that one dollar doesn't eggs at the grocery store the one dollar dozen of eggs that's made in
the factory farms also isn't going to do you any good because it locks all the nutrition that the
eggs from the backyard will have so there's a lot of think of sort of old thinking I've known a lot
of old farmers my grandpa was one and he hated chickens because he was the guy who had to go out
there with the shovel and scoop out the chicken house but that's not what we're talking about here
so you know you can't equate one with the other so I hope that you know people can see that
what Mr. Graber has proposed is eminently reasonable in comparison with what other successful
localities which were mentioned tonight I was involved in Charlottesville over a decade ago
helping them get their ordinance passed and it's been a huge success there's no reason to think
that the people of Winchester are any less responsible than the people of Charlottesville so I hope
you at least consider it so that the folks here in Florida County have the opportunity to raise
chickens in their backyard the former egg teacher from I believe was James Wood sent a letter out
to everyone today encouraging us to pass this ordinance because he sees multiple benefits
to allowing this ordinance to go forward especially from an educational standpoint so I hope
you'll consider that as well thank you Mr. Chairman thank you sir anyone else
all right supervisor Stagmeyer oh I'm sorry so you asked we're voting and my answer is no thank you
supervisor McCarthy yes all right you'll have to bear with me a second how to pencil failure
this is a supervisor McCarthy is yes supervisor slaughter thank you supervisor Wells yes
supervisor done no
supervisor Graber yes
you
share votes now motion fails
that will bring us to 12b the ordinance amendment the upgrade per the requirements of FEMA
our floodplain ordinances
thank you
thank you mr chairman members of the board on January 29th of this the end of this month
Frederick County will have new updated flood insurance rate maps from the from FEMA
so just a little background of what these maps are and why they're important
now these flood insurance rate maps they are the official community maps that show the
special flood hazard areas and the areas that have a risk premium zone so flood mapping
it's an important part of the national flood insurance program as it's the basis for the
program and their regulations and insurance requirements so with flood insurance
is available to property owners in Virginia mainly through the flood insurance program from FEMA
which is administered by them so community participation in the program it is voluntary
would note though in order to qualify to participate or buy insurance from the flood insurance
program the locality has to adopt a compliant flood plan insurance and be a part of the flood
insurance program so when accounting accounting does choose to join the program the community to the
community sorry we must make sure that we do maintain a compliant floodplain ordinance so when
these maps are updated we are then required to then update our ordinance and be compliant
so in Virginia the Virginia Department of Conservation Recreation DCR is the manager of the
states floodplain requirements and is designated as the coordinating agency by FEMA
so when maps are updated as we're going through this process now with our January 29th maps
we are given a model floodplain ordinance from the DCR that does outline the minimum requirements
necessary to maintain a compliant ordinance if we don't maintain that compliance open the
compliant ordinance for county would then lose our ability to participate in the flood insurance
program and it would fall back once you private insurance if someone's able to get that so
note in the ordinance that's in your packet there are a number of changes the majority of them are
really moving around some information consolidating there's not a lot of changes actually in it
one of the main sections is a new change to add an allowance for accessory structures to be
constructed within a floodplain so just kind of following up with the DCR model ordinance a
copy of is that also also in your agenda what we drafted our changes on meets the minimum
necessary there were back at your previous discussion before it was sent to public hearing staff
did point out some of the DCR recommended higher standards one was an 18 inch free board and
other was a revolving five year to for substantial improvements both of those were taken out because
that was the what the board sent forward for public hearing was the minimum and that is what is
in your agenda so history where this has been the development review and regulations committee
discussed this back in November planning commission discussion back on December 2nd it came
before this body at your December 9th meeting planning commission held a public clearing on December
17th and they did recommend approval so tonight this is presented for public hearing and we're
seeking a decision from the board on this amendment we'd be glad answer any questions questions
of Ms. Perkins anyone comment yes or comment no question yes okay I'll ask the question
so Ms. Perkins in this proposal I believe there's an additional offer opportunity for like 300
square feet below ground that was not in the previous which will allow for parking lots with
garages is that to be any correct something that we talked about earlier today
there's there was a variance stipulation for but the primary changes is a 600 square foot
allowance for garages and things that nature that are uninhabitable or not used for residential
purposes thank you the questions of Ms. Perkins anyone says a public hearing would anyone like
to comment concerning these proposed changes anyone last chance we'll close the public comment
portion of the meeting how would the board like to handle this one and now any comment you might
like to make Mr. Chairman I wouldn't move for adoption yes we have a motion to adopt second
second is there any further discussion now I will make a comment yes so Ms. Perkins I admit
through this in detail so thank you very much for your time I want you all to know that you
took a half of our time call it back with numbers it was very helpful it's not something we don't
deal with every day I appreciate you're going through it and explain the differences between one
side and the other answer our questions thank you other comments anyone
supervisor Graber hi supervisor done hi supervisor well
supervisor slaughter supervisor McCartes supervisor Stagmar chair votes are motion carries
that will bring us to a planning commission no board liaison reports are there any
anyone citizen comments this is a portion of meeting that we set aside for citizens to share
anything they would like with the board is there anyone who would like to address the board
anyone well you all work it out
Mr. Chairman members of the board Barbara Jean Burrows 37 years in the Opec and District
before I make this statement I would like to thank all of you for your service and I'm sincerely
sorry for the abuse that you have to take sometimes from the citizens it's abundantly clear to me
sitting through this meeting that you study the issues that are put to you and have some intelligent
comments be they're yay or nay so I'm sorry that you have to suffer and you're going to have to
bear with me because I feel very emotional wish to enter a statement into the public historical
record of Frederick County Commonwealth of Virginia the United States of America as follows
on the date of January 6 2021 the federal capital the United States of America was a target of an
insurrection by the followers of President Donald J. Trump I wholeheartedly urged the federal
government to pursue and prosecute all persons and organizations that contributed to a siege that
resulted not only in the destruction of property belonging to the citizens of this country but also
the untimely deaths of at least five people in the injury of many more may God help us all in these
perilous times thank you thank you yes ma'am
hello I am Latasha doze from right here in Steven City and I want it to address the denial of
adopting Juneteenth as a look as part of this locality's calendar the motion died when no other
supervisors decided to second it it was incredibly disheartening to read in the paper that this
Virginia state holiday was not adopted it was also concerning as a member of NAACP and coming to
the table I am unaware of any healthy community conversations surrounding the importance of
adopting such an issue for your constituents of color quote it seems based on how it
strange the state and federal government are as we continue to have our own values and priorities
that I would ask that we take an opportunity to revisit that particular policy to see if we
might be able to make something that we are more have more of a say in stegmeyer said in quote my
first question to you supervise a stegmeyer is who exactly are we in the Winchester star article
in regards your decision to not adopt and recognize Juneteenth as a holiday exerted your ignorance
to the significance of this date yes Juneteenth is a celebration of slaves freed in Galveston
Texas two years after the emancipation proclamation was delivered however we as African-American people
celebrate with our ancestors their resiliency their strength and their power although you may not
deem it as an appropriate locality holiday your constituents particularly those of African descent
so strongly about the recognition locally especially since it is recognized by the governor of
Virginia lack of conversation beyond your seats with your constituents about issues that
concern them acknowledges them and or celebrates them proves that the power of your seats are more
important than your constituents of color in the article supervisor done stated that he did not
want to confuse our teens and high schoolers about the history of freeing our slaves the statement
concludes that one our young people are easily miseducated and two our school system is ill equipped to
educate our youth about the truth of our nation's history why can't we use Juneteenth as an
educational tool for the locality as a whole our youth are incredibly in their words woke
and open to diversity and exposure of culture through social media TikTok for example I'm amazed at
how our young people use these platforms to not only educate themselves but some of us adults as
well each holiday has a history yet when it comes to what you may see as a trend due to this past
summer's events we as a people have been celebrating since 1865 this is not a trend is a moment to
start shifting from uplifting the rebel conspiracy to empowering celebrating and creating safe spaces
for African-American people in our country our state and especially our locality supervisor done
also said if the county were to celebrate the emancipation of slaves it should observe the
anniversary of the 13th amendment of the constitution which abolished slavery and involuntarily
servitude as an African-American woman I have not asked for options that you would be comfortable
accepting I ask for you to reconsider thank you thank you anyone else
thank you good evening my name is Rebecca Lewis I am the chair of the political action committee of
the NAACP I speak partially on that behalf and partially as a resident of the back creek district
and I'm also like to speak on reconsidering putting gene teeth back on the agenda for a soon
upcoming meeting the date of independence for many black people they recognize that as June 19th 1865
the day that the news of the emancipation proclamation finally reached some of the last people
America still held in bondage the liberation gene teeth commemorates is cause for celebration
but it also reminds us how a quality can be delayed on June 19th 1865 on the shores of Galveston
Texas Union General Gordon Granger arrived by boat to announce to enslaved to African-Americans
that the civil war had ended and they were now free while president Lincoln's emancipation
proclamation was issued two and a half years prior the civil war had ended in April of that year
it wasn't until June 19th 1865 that black people in America were made free we should honor
their lives and celebrate that day of freedom forever from almost the moment that slavery's demise
was declared in Texas freed African-Americans and their descendants have been celebrating
gene teeth first in Texas and then across the south and northward as families migrated during
the 20th century the day has been a warmly celebrated occasion filled with reunions,
praids and feasting Texas recognized it as a paid holiday in 1980 today 47 states and Washington
DC marked gene teeth as either holiday or an observance the momentum to seize upon the day is
something for all of America to celebrate is expanding and harmony with the mounting national
demand for racial justice following the police killing of George Floyd this summer an estimated
15 million to 25 million people in two thousand five hundred towns cities and counties
including Winchester and Frederick County took to the streets after George Floyd's death
the shared national exhaustion within equality has reached a fever fever pitch and a growing
embrace of gene teeth reflects that major corporations such as JC Penny Nike Spotify target
Twitter and Uber have recently declared it a company holiday New York and Virginia have just
joined the states that are now reserving it as a paid holiday for their workers it won't necessarily
be easy passing this but the last federal holiday that was passed to come on married the life of
Dr. Montgomery 3rd King Jr was proposed in 1968 and didn't become a reality for nearly 20 years
I hope that it doesn't take us nearly that long to do the right thing and put gene teeth back
on the agenda for the next meeting and then pass it as a Frederick County holiday thank you so much
thank you is there anyone else yes ma'am
well thanks again for hearing my concerns tonight I'm Christine Stevens a resident and
constituent of the town of Steven City I'm a community leader a member of coming to the table
and a mother of six beautiful brown-skinned children I help them identify their strengths
and embrace their self-pride and their identity June teeth is an American holiday the true
independence of all Americans took place on June 19 1865 if we are the United States of America
this is important this is an important part in American history and it should not only be
recognized it should be celebrated my question is how can we truly celebrate July 4th as the
only Independence Day on hundreds of thousands of people were still enslaved how is it that all
and all white board has decided that a major day in American history is it worth celebrating in
Virgin County if your ancestors were emancipated on this day in history one assumes you would feel
compelled to acknowledge it with a celebration speeches songs and more taking a narrow-minded
approach and path on this issue is exactly why I stand here pleading with this board to consider
the necessity of deep equity training for youth but as you can see here a don't need it as well
what we must do to achieve what what what must we do to achieve this in this community to help
recognize I'm sorry what must we do to achieve I'm all flustered now but may I add that neither of
the supervisors are black and I wouldn't be able to tell you how you should feel as a person
that's white equally you cannot tell me how I feel as a person of color you're diminishing the
experiences of black residents which it is a problem some say Juneteenth is a Texas holiday
as minorities we celebrate it as the end of all slavery Juneteenth is the final and end
and I must add that black people is still experiencing a former slavery through systems I ask you to
consider your previous decision and add Juneteenth to the Frederick County calendar to be recognized
and celebrated thank you so much thank you so anyone else yes sir good evening everyone my name
is Brian Nurem resident of the OPEC in district according to the Winchester star for the county
decline establishing the observance of Juneteenth the end of slavery in America as a county holiday
despite a four to one vote from the Human Resources Committee in favor of that the motion was made
without the recommendation of the head of that committee ringing that bell most likely discourage
to second and the motion died why now supervisor Dunn offered a solution he stated that he'd
prefer to see the holiday celebrated on the actual day that emancipation was declared either on
December 6th or 18th but having another holiday on in December putting it in June would kind
of spread it out wouldn't it also applaud supervisor McCarthy for suggesting to alter it and make it
emancipation day making it a holiday that's more relevant to the county however when I'm saying
those are just pragmatic and rather minor points the real matter is what we want to remember as a
community what is truly important to memorialize to quote supervisor Stegmeyer it just seems based
on how estranged the state and federal government are as we continue to have our own values and
priorities interesting as a historian in training I was curious as to what role emancipation played
in our area as it happens in 2016 a doctoral candidate's thesis was presented at the College of
William & Mary titled oh Shenandoah the northern Shenandoah valleys blackboarder landers make freedom
work during Virginia's reconstruction 1865 to 1870 the candidate at the time found that labor
shortages here were filled by freed men migrating from the tidewater in Piedmont regions supported
by reformers and the freedman's bureau the formerly enslaved became truly free people not just
emancipated dependence this influx of labor actually revitalized the valley from a war torn region
into an area more productive than it had than even before the war she also investigated the uneven
oppression of the newtly of freed in this area local conservative opinions ranged from simply
trying to deny them their civil rights keeping them in a servile state to a very few that tried
keeping a white control order that didn't actively resist them from settling so I ask you are
these the values that we want to memorialize the argument really seems to be the conflict that
some imagine exists between Richmond and Frederick County just because it was passed into law by
General Assembly and declared by governor Northam what priorities are served by this
therefore I ask that this board move to reconsider the motion to establish June
teeth or emancipation day as a county holiday why not recognize the freedom given that was
given with the end of slavery we celebrate our emancipation from colonial servitude
can we not also celebrate the emancipation of the enslaved as well thank you
thank you sir anyone else yes ma'am
it's okay take a breath
I count you not prepared what I'm about to say I stepped out of this room for a moment only to
hear the passion that was being said through those doors I'm speaking on a whim and I have to say
I am embarrassed that I stood here and spoke about chickens the decision that the board made to
not recognize June 13th is a very poor decision it's not recognizing the community of its whole
I'm chair for First Night Winchester and we celebrate the diversity of our community that's in
our mission statement and I believe that your decision to not recognize June 13th excuse me
June 19th I'm sorry June 10th June 10th to not recognize June the June 10th is not recognizing the
diversity of this community so I hope that you guys will consider reversing your decision
and making this possible I think it's very important especially in the state in which we're in
right now as a country I think you're doing a disservice thank you thank you sir anyone else
anyone
last chance all right we'll close the public comment portion
board of supervisors comments I might supervise her
thank you miss chairman I'm going to take this off so it'll be a little bit more clear if that's
all right this is a point of clarification
I'm I'm speaking directly to the group it was up here sir I'm just kind of waiting it's okay
point of clarification at our last board meeting a motion was presented to change the name
of the state mandated and Frederick County approved holiday from June 10th to a emancipation day
the motion died for lack of a second let me say that again at our last board meeting the motion
was presented to change the name of June 10th to emancipation day that was the motion it is
available by record if you'd like to look at it I have a copy over here but that's what we that's
what the motion was and supervisor Dunn's brought it here and said I'm bringing it before you
but I won't vote for it he was not going to vote for changing the name
that being said it's evident from the passion tonight and everything else there's a lot of
misconception here I've received a lot of calls and I said gee was I must have been out in left
field and not understood what I was talking about but I went back and reviewed with my
fellow board members some of them and said did I miss out on this and they said no that's
what we understood too we were not in favor of changing the name to emancipation day we were
in favor of leaving the name as June 10th now we celebrated Frederick County put this on the
calendar calendar and celebrated last year on 2019 and have every intention of celebrating it
this year 2020 I mean 2020 I'm sorry I'm sorry I missed out I'm a year ahead of myself but
anyway it was if the employees were given the day off as June 10th it was added to our calendar
so what has happened in the past is we have we followed since the 1970s we followed the state
and federal guidelines when one of those vacations or holidays is set in place Frederick County's
policy has been to add that into their calendar and we have done that if you go back and look that's
exactly what we've done I think my I told you what happened so it I heard what you said I think
there's misconceptions and misunderstandings but June 10th is a Frederick County holiday now that
being said we've had a real problem over the years we have a list of holidays we've had veterans
day and they've changed that name and they've come up with a different name and so forth so my
suggestion to our board is to when we do our holidays that we simply just say that
the Frederick County policy regarding holidays including approval of June 10th to be recognized
and referred to not by title but just as those holidays that Frederick County recognizes that way
if the federal government of the state government decides to change the name we don't have to have
a board meeting to decide whether we like that name or not it will just be that holiday that
leads Jackson days no longer leads Jackson day so let's just celebrate the day that we're we're
supposed to be celebrating and not worry about the name so that would be my suggestion to the board
that we do that in the future and that we move ahead and and celebrate the holidays as they are
presented to us by our state government and our federal government with the option of adding days
like we do for Apple Blossom that's a local holiday that doesn't celebrate any place else so I'd
like to leave that in where Frederick County has the option if we want to adopt something just for
our county we can can do that for you attending just to eliminate the list yes list of firm that we
will we will follow federal and state declared holidays absolutely plus the Friday of Apple Blossom
and any other that this board might choose to adopt yes sir is that it yes sir all right my
suggestion would be that we send that to the HR committee with that direction are there any other
comments mr chairman yes sir supervise my car thank you mr. I feel like tonight is sort of like a
serial of one issue after another where there's miscommunication because we're not talking to each
other the motion wasn't to change the name of Juneteenth the motion came from the committee to
acknowledge June 19th as a paid holiday for public employees that I'm on the human resources
committee and at the human resources committee there were a lot of different reasons why people
were concerned and it wasn't there were no one said I don't want to celebrate a emancipation
or the end of slavery that wasn't ever brought up as a concern some of the concerns were okay we
already have a lot of paid holidays do we add it is another paid holiday so it wasn't we don't
recognize June 19th because the state recognizes June 19th it's if we have to as a subordinate of the
state recognize June 19th that's not the question the question was should it be a paid holiday
the other concerns were and acid in the paper the actual end of slavery took place six months later
with the signing of the 13th amendment so should we celebrate that day I think it's a legitimate
question now that's not necessarily the answer but until we have discussions until we talk through
these things and we talk to people in our community and we hear the different perspectives I think
that's the important part that we're missing is we may not come to a conclusion that everybody
is happy with but I think at least all of us here on this board as far as I know you we all
believe that celebrating the end of slavery is a worthy thing to do and we need to find a way
to do it that's why at that meeting there is potential that that wasn't going to be forwarded
to this board and one of the questions was a lot of people in Virginia don't know what June
19th means or what date it is before two years ago I had never heard the term June 19th
that doesn't mean that it's not a worthy holiday it just means I had never heard of it before
and there's a lot of other people so one of the concerns was the name I wanted to make sure that
it got to this committee but to this board so I actually suggested we approve it I was the one
who made the motion we approve it with the name I'm anticipation day because it's pretty clear
at that point what we're celebrating everyone that looks at that title and maybe I was wrong I don't
know but I wanted to make sure we at least got it here for the discussion so I think this
I think supervisor Wells you're sincere when you say I thought that we were changing the name
and Judy your suggestion check your head this is where I think if we the world is so crazy
and talks you to be right now and everyone's under so much pressure we don't even have the time
anymore to really dig in and think about things and consider things clearly before we make decisions
we rush through things I hope that we can sort of take a pause and say let's take our time let's
not rush into things let's do things the right way let's start to talk to each other let's have
these conversations I think it's great that you came here I think it's great that Michael phazon
reach out to me I think we have opportunities that we can talk through these things so that we can
hear all the different sides all the different the stories matter that's the important thing because
if we understand the stories then we can we can explain to people what are we really celebrating
I guarantee you if you asked a lot of kids today you know what's the date of America's independence
a lot of them wouldn't know because it's become a day of hot dogs and fireworks you know we need to
get back to talking about the story of why we do these things and I think it's important that we
have that conversation so I just feel like hopefully working together we can have these discussions
and and before we decide to move forward with just saying let's just eliminate the list I don't
think we should eliminate those I think we need to be clear about who we are and what we celebrate
and we keep a list so I hope before we instruct the board or the committee to make that decision
that we have that conversation first with the community and that's why I'm going to have the
town halls I think that's a good start and I'm not perfect and I do the best I can but I think if
and I know you all do too if we can start having that conversation first before we just say well
let's send this back to committee and decide on this let's talk about it first so that's all I
would say before we before we do that. Mr. Pajor Schler? Chairman I prepared some remarks too because
quite frankly I was very troubled by the published article of the Boards Failure to Act on the
recommendation from the human resources meeting committee at the December 9th Board of Supervisors
meeting while the Winchester Stars December 12th article states the board declined to add Juneteenth
as a county holiday that issue is not what I understood the board was addressing at the time the
motion was made since the article appeared I have reviewed all information received in our
Board of Supervisors packet the motion made by supervisor Dunn the human resource policy 8.2
in the video of our board meeting Frederick County's current human resource policy states
the county shall observe federal and state holidays and other such holidays as may be prescribed
by the Board of Supervisors in fact Frederick County observed the Juneteenth holiday this past year
what I believe the night of the meeting was that the board was being asked to recognize
and refer to or in effect rename the holiday as a mancipation day not whether or not we were going to
add Juneteenth as a new holiday supervisor Dunn made the motion on behalf of this human resource
committee as follows the human resource committee made a recommendation to change Frederick County
policy regarding the holidays including approval that the Juneteenth holiday be recognized
and referred to as a mancipation day in Frederick County on behalf of the committee and simply on
behalf of the committee and this is in quotes I'll make that recommendation although I do not
support it the motion died for lack of a second at the time I was under the impression that the
question before us was only the local referencing of the Juneteenth holiday as a mancipation day
not whether or not we would observe the holiday at all regardless of the title the question in my
mind before the board that night because we have a policy in place that says we will observe
federal and state holidays that is what I understood we were addressing that was not the motion
that was presented to us as to whether we would observe the holiday it was whether we would
approve that the holiday be recognized and referred to as a mancipation day therefore I did not
make a motion or agree to approve that that was what I understood I was voting on
anyone else should be Rosardine thank you all for your comments appreciate your opportunity
to reach out as Mr. McCarthy said he's going to have a town hall meeting or meeting with those
that are interested I hope to join you at that meeting and I hope you would join us at that meeting
so we could all sit and chat I'm sure the HR committee and the committee voted you know to go
forward with this my concerns and well and I'll make some comments and then we can have a much
larger and longer discussion when when Mr. McCarthy has his town hall and you come my concerns with
Juneteenth were as follows and I come I was born in New Jersey Juneteenth freed slaves in Texas
but in July August September October and November if you were a slave in the state of New Jersey
and there were about 16 in New Jersey in Delaware 1700 in Maryland in the District of Columbia
and in Missouri if you are a slave there and you went to your master and said I'm free he said no you
aren't you're still a slave the law says the you are a slave the Jersey ironically was one of the
states and so on let me just walk through and so on December 6 1865 Georgia passed a resolution
of the 13th Amendment which then set in motion two weeks later Secretary of State Stuart saying yes
I will verify this motion the law slaves are free if you had been a slave in New Jersey in November
you were not free if you were a slave in Maryland you were not free and so one of the questions we
can discuss about later is how do you what do you say to people if they've been there in those states
and they weren't free and that was my concern on emancipation day on Juneteenth I am glad
that everyone's free I don't think anybody should be a slave to anybody but the historical accuracy
is either December 6th the date that Georgia said yes or more importantly December 18th when
the Secretary of State verified that yes the 13th Amendment is now ratified and going forward
and so that was you know my thought process both you disagree with me I'll be glad to chat with you
it's a two-way conversation but that was the thought process on on that so when Mr. McCarthy has his
meeting I hope to be there hope you can be there and we can have a good conversation thank you
Mr. Chairman change the topic still one more comment supervisor comments
on this issue of the radios I will write something to all of you just laying out you know
hear my concerns share my thoughts give you all the chance to go and read it this is slaughter
I know you have a concern on time I'll lay out a suggestion of proposal and you know we can
address it as we go forward so just lay out my concerns lay out my thoughts let it propose
timeline you can modify it as you see fit and hopefully we'll be able to get a radio system works
for the county in a short time frame thank you thank you Mr. Chairman thank you Mr. Chairman two
comments first Saturday was law enforcement appreciation day I would like to take a moment and say
thank you to all those who put a badge on every morning and do their job to protect the citizens of
this county if you are a constitutionalist and are upholding the constitutional values as late
forth I will support you wholeheartedly in the future as it has been a very uncertain time frame
this past year for many of you I encourage you to uphold your oath the second thing that I have is
a question it is an email that I received this last week I believe regarding a one-on-one
school board meeting with our direct school board representation I was very taken aback by
the email my school board representative and I speak pretty much every week sometimes several
times a week to try to keep each other up to speed on where we are the capital improvement plan
the projections have some very new things in them to include a hundred million dollars that they
are requesting from this board which is significant I have a question for both the
county administrator and chairman of the board as to how we got to that
discussion of the dates picked and that there would be simply a one-on-one session instead of a
open dialogue of the entire board if you are familiar nine months ago we ask for an open
dialogue of both boards for both boards to sit down and meet and have discussion that has still
yet to occur I'm open to listening what the school board has to say what their needs are but I'm
also open to knowing answers to the questions in which I ask some of which I'm still waiting for some
of which they want seven thousand six hundred hours to give me an answer I'm still scratching my
head on that so I'd like to ask our county administrator did you have any input or was there any
discussion on picking the one-on-one dates and in that arrangement how did that come to be
in light of the repeated request of this board to have discussion and repeated comments from
the chairman that we all get the information at the same time because I have a feeling if we have
seven different discussions with seven board members of this board and seven different board
members of the school board that we likely may not get the same answers to our questions and
or we will not be getting the same answers at the same time which I think addition franchises all
of us so I just like an answer to my question how was that determined who made that determination
what how did that originate
so just for clarification on my behalf did that come from diviner did that come from the chairman
of the school board
or so I had to go back and look at the email it came from them
I also have a have a strong reservation to think that an unelected bureaucrat being
survived makes decisions arbitrarily without any input or discussion from either board or body
and that is very concerning to me I think it's time that we have some understanding of our boundaries
and our rules and it's concerning to think that we have folks who are making decisions for
this board and trying to influence the outcome of those decisions and the matter in which they're
using thank you
I have two comments to make one in response to a constituent who wrote me a letter
but my first comment has to do with this whole matter of the holiday of Juneteenth and
how we as a community in Frederick County and in Northern Shenandole Valley
handle a variety of issues and whether they are handled in a
in a sensitive way or not and I want to thank
supervisor McCarthy for his discussions with the new chairman of the NAACP and the fact that
there will be this town I'm sorry president okay and that that to me is is what we should be
doing more of and and it's not that should not that discussion that will be had shouldn't be the
end of the discussion about issues that people feel strongly about as many of us have pointed out
just this evening we there's there's been a lack of communication that has really harmed us
and we need to make certain that we change the way that we operate and the way that we make decisions
and and the way that we communicate I heard and maybe I'm wrong but that
one of the things that that that Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King mentioned in in a variety of
things that I've read about him is that he he disdained people who just did things in a superficial
way sure we'll just handle that just to get rid of the issue instead of dealing with the problem
in all of its its depth and complexity and and racial issues are especially difficult for us as
as an American family I heard that the Virginia General Assembly bothered to wait until the
very end of the session to vote by voice vote to establish the holiday of Juneteenth and that
the governor did not spend a lot of sincere attention on that holiday that he passed that to me
is not the way that we should be doing things and I like the approach that we are taking here to
have a discussion about it ultimately I agree with supervisor McCarthy I don't think it should
be Juneteenth which is an inaccurate designation of the end of slavery we should celebrate emancipation
and celebrate the fact that the the Constitution the the basis of our society chose to pass
it the end of slavery for all of us in by the 13th amendment so I but that discussion can be had
and I and I'm looking forward to being on the Human Resources Committee that will give me I believe
I'm appointed to that will give me a chance to talk to others about that about that issue
I I also wanted to say that I was I was troubled by a letter that that was sent to me
it was by a shoddy constituent who insinuated that President Trump and members of the Republican
Party organized a coup d'etat on January 6th at the U.S. Capitol that's his terminology
he also asked in that letter to report to the FBI any quote criminal and violent acts that
took place on that day day and he insinuated that some people of Frederick County were involved
he asked his elected representative that I make a statement condemning these actions and I would
like to respond to him in in this way I was very disappointed by the words I heard on television
that President Trump uttered at the rally at which he did not take the opportunity to
restrain the anger of those attending the rally I was also troubled by the incendiary marks I heard
from Donald Trump Jr. and Attorney Rudy Giuliani unfortunately on that day there were divisive
comments by President elect Biden that did not do anything to create a more peaceful atmosphere
there is no place for violence in our society and especially and I would say in the public
sphere but also in our private lives we need to take responsibility for the amount of abuse that's
taking place in our own families and I would say that we need to be very conscious of
how we handle things in the political arena such as this gathering tonight and I condemn all
incidents of violence against all Americans in all forms and in all situations however
I will ask my neighbor in the Shawnee district not to blame the irresponsible acts of a few
hundred individuals on the approximately 100,000 American citizens in attendance that day
and he insinuates he should not also insinuate that the good law abiding people of Frederick County
and the northern Shenandoah Valley who were on that bus that went into the DC were culpable for the
violent acts of less than 1% of the of the people attending those from the valley as well as
thousands of others were simply exercising their constitutional rights under the first amendment
to peaceably assemble reasonable people of both parties are still confused about the poor
preparations for a crowd of that size who were focused on the activities taking place in the
capital by a joint session of Congress the security of the capital is with the capital police however
they are managed by a bipartisan group of House and Senate members on the House and Senate
administration committees speaker Pelosi and majority leader McConnell need to take the blame for
this shocking lack of preparation I must add that most of the citizens such as the ones who
participated in Winchester were extra who were exercising their constitutional rights to march
peacefully this summer to protest the tragic death of George Floyd were exercising their rights
as well and it was only a minority that had a not in Winchester but elsewhere that had a violent
agenda violence needs to be condemned wherever we witness it and when violence and riots and
looting take took place in over 150 cities during the summer hardly a peep was heard from
Democrats in condemning the violence led by Antifa and Black Lives Matter whose Marxist beliefs
espoused the destruction of our country its government its history and its constitution
we Americans Democrats and Republicans must unite in committing to a political process that
will never condone violence of any kind I commit myself to this and I invite my neighbor who
asked me to speak this evening in Shawnee district to make this commitment as well thank you for
the opportunity to express myself Mr. Chairman I need a clarification here at the beginning of the
meeting there was a comment made by yourself that there have been no appointments to committees
in last year I was pretty snug pretty much snug on any committee of importance just heard Mr.
Stagmeyer make a comment that he was appointed to the Human Resources Committee until he corrected
himself and he believed that he had been appointed to the Human Resources Committee so I'd like
a little clarification from you sir have you discussed appointments to committees with anybody
because it sounds to me like you have and secondly to that I know myself and a couple other
supervisors I've talked to that have I've asked about it if they'd heard anything about committees
had also like was not heard anything so it makes me really wonder if there's some underhanded
stuff going on here and my biggest question is you have stated multiple times to me sir that
we all need to hear the same information at the same time and it doesn't appear that that's
happening Mr. McCarthy has done a good job but laying out tonight that we have need we have a
dire need to have much better communication and we have a dire need for us all to hear it at the
same time it appears some of that miscommunication and maybe under the table communication may
be coming from yourself I would really significantly appreciate being included on those conversations
into my conversation that's enough of that I had asked you for input on committee assignments I
got similar input from supervisor Dunn I got the thought that he would like to serve on HR from
Dave right after he was elected when we started I said you need to look at our committee structure
think about it give me what input you have I said this evening that I will have that hopefully
in the next few days I have been working on it I haven't reviewed my worksheet with anyone
at all fair enough thank you much it is fair enough I was not saying completely
that we should attempt to make sure that every one of our members sees the same information from
the same source at the same time I have always felt that way so my question here in lies again as
I made mentioned during my first comments Mr. Chairman why was the email permitted to move forward
regarding the school board and board supervisors one on one comments why was the comment made
tonight that you had discussion with him about the human resources committee I as well put in a list
of committees that I thought I could serve on but I wasn't given that same conversation so I'm a
little confused you're we can agree to discuss this at another time but it is very disheartening to me
so I had one other on my list if there are no other comments I just have one really great
yes and I apologize because I know no one wants to sit here any longer so we're here this is
supervisor Graber I respect you you know I respect you and I know that you have admitted to me
that sometimes you can go a little bit over the top in your comments and I appreciate that you're
humble enough to say that and I think I agree that I have a lot of questions just like you do I hope
that we can get to the point that before we make an accusation that we ask the question let the
answer come and then we can accuse them of one thing so I hope you understand I respect you more
than probably most people that you know are sitting at this table I really do but I hope that
for us to move forward that before we accuse somebody that we I mean you can make the statement
and say I didn't get the same treatment why is that without saying there's underhanded stuff going
on I didn't say that there was underhand stuff going on so just as a colleague to a colleague I
appreciate your hard work I appreciate that you you really do and I hope you don't take offense
at this but I really hope for us to move forward that we can get at least beyond that that small
part of the accusation because I don't know what's in in any of our hearts I just know that when
something's not done properly I can call it out but I don't know who's being honest or dishonest
what's in the heart so that's that part I think is really what's staying sometimes and if we can
get beyond that I think it would be helpful thank you Mr. Chairman thank you sir there's no one else
I had a request from a constituent that the planning department might send to the DRRC
ask for a discussion about the potential of adding boat repair as an option for a conditional
use permit application in the RA at the definition needs to be looked at we we permit automobile repair
in the RA as a conditional use permit potential boat repair is not mentioned anywhere it made sense to
me I'm asking if anybody would object if we see if planning would study them thank you
that was all I had uh anyone else have anything vice chairman well
the chairman I move the weird George second all those in favor I we thank everyone for their time
attention and their input
you
you
