County of Frederick, Virginia.
Mr. Chairman.
This is a public hearing for approval of bonds.
This was a supplemental appropriation for our school and the amount of $3.2 million attached
in your agenda is the resolution which authorizes the issuance of bonds, not to each three,
the $3.2 million super tentative schools and the finance director for schools are here if you have questions.
But I think this is fairly straightforward.
Thank you, sir.

Anyone at all?

Anyone?
Yes, ma'am.
If you'd come forward.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
My name is Jeanette Niel.
I am in the Red Bud District.
So I'd like to bring to your attention something that we addressed to the school board last week concerning our neighborhood.
We, um, there are some of us here from our neighborhood that live in the Lynn Haven community.
And if you know what school sits right next to Lynn Haven community is the Greenwood Mill Elementary School.
And it's the only school currently in our district that is a neighborhood school.
Um, about 10 days ago at 7.57 p.m., we had a gunshot go off right outside of school grounds.
Um, on that same area, um, by the fence.
Um, 20 minutes earlier, one of our neighbors was outside at that exact location teaching their child how to ride a bike.
Um, eight weeks previously, we had an incident where several shots were fired, right, at the same location.
Um, and that happened at 12.57, I believe, p.m.
Um, this is a problem because this school needs to be treated as a community center versus just not just a school that all of our children are enrolled in.
Um, the school is used for, um, basic rec, which is through you.
Frederick County uses it for soccer and football, which is through you.
Um, meetings, I know, Mr. Dunne, you've had meetings at the community center.
We have birthday parties, we have lots of different things.
We have a community exercise center that's open all the way until 9.30 p.m., which is well passed light, you know, it's very dark during winter time.
So all of these things fall under you.
Um, and we have gone as a community.
We've gone to the sheriff's office and they have been so vigilant.
They have helped us so much have been patrolling the area a lot more.
They've come to a neighborhood meeting, which we greatly appreciated.
We went to the school board and asked for the lights to stay on and they did immediately.
They've gone from staying on only until like 7 p.m.
And now they're all the way through the night.
The issue here is, is we need more of that.
It's a safety concern that greatly involves you.
And we need your help to help fund this.
We're going to try and do our best on the HOA end to do what we can.
And the school is doing what they can and the sheriff is doing what they can.
But with a growing community, we can't rely on just the sheriff's office to be patrolling when the, it just continues to grow.
Um, and so we need your help in making this a situation that's safer for us.
All of us were out and about.
You can find any of us running, exercising, hanging out with our kids, talking with our neighbors.
Any time in between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. honestly.
And these things are not happening just at night anymore.
They're happening at 7.57 p.m. where 20 minutes previously, there was a child and his father on that exact location.
That same event, we had a couple who was out for a walk who had to take cover behind a car.
Um, so we, we don't see this as a problem with the school itself.
When our kids are at school, we're all, we have great faith in, in the school itself.
They're safe. There's a locked system. There's security cameras.
But right now, we only have three lamp posts that cover the region where the incidents have taken place.
And if you drive by our school any time at night and look at those three lights, there are so many pockets of darkness where things are taking place.
And that's why drugs are being dealt in the area. We're finding condoms.
We're finding needles on our playground.
Um, we have to treat this as a community center and not just a school.
And we really need your help. Thank you.
Thank you.
Is anyone else would like to bring anything to the attention of the board? Anyone at all?
Last call?
Yes, ma'am.
If we could have your name and Magisterial District, please.
You'll, you'll want to pull that microphone down because I'm kind of short.
Thank you.
It goes up and down all night.
Just to echo what Jeanette said, my husband and my three boys were at the playground riding.
He was teaching them how to ride a bike, 20 minutes before the incident happened.
And one of the reason we have a lot of healthcare providers in that neighborhood.
And one of the reason the realtor sold those properties to us is because we can walk our kids to school.
And that was an asset to us.
We could have easily lived in Winchester City, but we chose that area.
Winchester way is closer to the hospital where we can get to work or our husbands can get to work.
But we chose that neighborhood because we can walk our kids to school.
It's a community area.
And to have some, this kind of incident happen is frightening.
We're scared for our kids.
We're scared for our neighbors.
We're scared for our children over there.
And it really bothers us.
And we really, really, it touches a lot of our hearts.
A lot of us that are here and mothers.
We should be putting our kids to sleep now.
We should be making dinner.
But we left them with the husbands and with the sisters to be here to let us let you know how it deeply concerns us.
That's all I have to share.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Yes, sir.
So I'm Bill Meyer from Redbug District also.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
I'll let you know.
There he is.
All right.
Bill Meyer from Redbug District just to kind of reiterate what they were saying.
We were actually on our roof that night hanging up some lights and so forth for the holidays.
And obviously we heard the commotion, everything on the school grounds.
And then it ended up in the road with a gunfire or so forth.
And so that's kind of what happened that night.
So I think as stocking with some of the other residents in the area, what I think we're asking for is some help from folks.
Or is some help from funding from Frederick County, not necessarily a school, but I mean if the school can help also, that would be great.
But possibly installing some additional lights, cameras that can kind of police that area to prevent that type of activity from going on.
The more they know and the more we call the sheriff's department out, the less likely those individuals are going to be able to come back also.
But I think the cameras are definitely huge help.
Most of us have cameras on our homes, which some of us are actually increasing the quality of those cameras to be able to.
Capture a little bit more of the street to be able to help with that also.
So if that would be an appropriation and be appropriate, we'd greatly appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
We'll depend on the building and grounds committee of schools to look at that issue and try to develop a plan.
And parks and recs actually does the grounds of maintenance for the school systems.
So they will be able to identify what kinds of debris and such that they find over and above what I'm sure that you all find.
This is really shame.
I mean, that's the closest we have ever come to being able to actually have a neighborhood school, that real neighborhood school.
It's very, very concerned about that.
Anyone else like to speak?
Mr. Crayer.
Sean Crayer, a background district.
I just wanted to address something that the Board of Supervisors spoke about at the last meeting for several minutes right at the end of the meeting.
And that was pertaining to broadband.
There was a lot of discussion regarding towers and the height of those towers and the rules pertaining to those.
I was very encouraged by the discussion that this Board had.
And I would like to encourage this Board to pursue this issue strongly with the thought process of having a dividing line being interstate 81.
If you look at the interstate, the east side of interstate 81 and the west side of interstate 81, you have a mountainous and different topography that would affect the ability of a tower to operate for data for folks, especially in my district.
If you look at the Virginia Department of Game and Animal and Fisheries, they to use the I81 corridor as west of the Blue Ridge or east of the Blue Ridge for how they set their laws pertaining to game regulation.
We could have the same as far as regulations on our tower height and regulations for data center or data transmission in regards to the interstate and save a lot of taxpayer money by not pursuing maybe broadband at this time.
But allowing our private industry to develop on a as needed basis. Thank you for your time.
Thank you, sir. Anyone else like to address the board on any issue? Anyone? Last call? All right. Thank you very much. We appreciate your input.
Board of Supervisors comments. Are there any?
So I was going to ask I was planning on making a motion to have to task Chris or someone else to look into this issue, but you said that it's going to be taking care of buildings and grounds of schools.
Should should be where it should start. That discussion should start there, I think.
We needed to make a motion to move forward with anything. We don't. We could throw up. Thank you. I have one other comment, though.
So I wanted to draw attention to item six under the finance finance report tonight that Judy took us through where we approved a supplemental appropriation for 102,000 for sunny side plaza, the property that we purchased.
This $102,000 appropriation was for maintenance and operations and we approved it without hesitation.
I wanted to bring this up because every single time the school board approaches this board with a similar request generally using the words maintenance and operation or something even more specific.
It comes under great scrutiny for the board and I want us to begin thinking about why that is mostly because the school board is also independently elected just as we are on the board of supervisors.
We select their superintendent just as we select Chris, sorry, 300 bus Chris, but they serve at the pleasure of each board.
So my question is why do we have such a trust in Chris? And I think in this case it was actually Jay. Deputy, yeah, it was Jay. Have so much trust in them, but have no trust in doctors of mine.
So I would like us to think about that as we move forward into the next budget session and I just thought that this was a good moment to bring it up when we had something very clearly on the agenda to this point. Thank you.
Anyone else? Supervisor Dunn?
We're very much aware of the shootings that occurred a few weeks ago. The shootings that occurred around midnight a couple of weeks ago. I heard personally.
I was also very aware of the shootings that occurred at the school. I spoke to the sheriff and I've spoken to about this.
I've exchanged some email or some voicemails with Dr. Rondorf. He has said that they will keep as you know the lights on until midnight.
When we get into this budget process, I'm going to bring up this issue. Someone had to address that.
Some of the items on the agenda might be additional lighting and see if that works or not. So I think we just need to walk through the process.
I think we all want a safe area to be. I've walked up and down that street as much as anybody else here, I would think.
There's no need for shootings there. If we have a crime problem, we have a drug problem.
I'll make one of the comments and that is that if there's another incident like this, whether it's in Redbud or anyplace else.
If you have knowledge of what's occurred, please call the sheriff's office. I know that on social media, I've seen comments of A, B, and C.
I've called some of those people back to say, you know, if you know some information, call the sheriff.
And so the comments will remain tonight. Did I heard for the first time about one of the speakers?
So if you are aware of something, you've seen something and you had that time of an incident call the sheriff and say, hi, I'm such and such.
This is what I know and all those pieces together can help to solve a problem.
Some of the calls helped to solve the problem the last time.
If it occurs again, I just strongly urge you to do that. We're all in this together and we all recognize the threat.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir. Anyone else?
Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Kind of a lighter note, not to take away from the Redbud District, but I received a telephone call from a gentleman in my district who left his name as Marty and left his number as 86925, and that was it.
Marty, if you're out there listening, please call back.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir. Supervisor Loft.
Mr. Chairman, obviously we remind everyone that Monday, October 28th, we have our fifth annual transportation form right here in the boardroom.
I think we'll find a very interesting.
We hope to have someone here from the governor's office to explain the Route 81 taxation probability and other issues.
We'll have V dot here. We hope to have a lot of people here with a lot of information. So please put that on your calendar 630 Monday, October 28th.
Good.
