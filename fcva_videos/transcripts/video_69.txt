I'm going to call the order meeting to the November 4th, 2020 Federal County Planning Commission.
If you would, join me in a moment of silence, please.
Thank you.
First, next item on our agenda is the adoption of our agenda.
There's no changes to how it's presented to us tonight.
I'll accept a motion to approve the agenda.
Second.
All those in favor?
Aye.
Aye.
Agenda is approved for tonight.
Our next item is our meeting minutes from October 7th, 2020.
If everyone's had a chance to read them, there's no corrections or changes to the minutes.
I'll accept a motion to approve those minutes.
Second.
All those in favor?
Aye.
Aye.
The minutes are approved from October 7th, meeting.
Committee reports.
I know we had none.
If I look around, I don't think we had any reports.
I know we might have had a transportation of Mr. Oates is not here tonight, so we'll move on.
I don't see a Winchester planning liaison.
That means Mr. Graver, you're the only one that could possibly save the day on reports.
And he has none.
All right.
We'll move on from the committee reports, citizen comments.
This is a portion of our meeting where we go into citizen comments.
You can come before us and speak to anything that's not on our agenda tonight.
Seeing nothing, I had no citizens forward.
I will close citizen comments.
Our next item is our public hearing.
And this Perkins is presenting a 2035 CPPA Northeast land use plan with Suaza service boundary limits.
Miss Perkins.
Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.
Back at the Board of Supervisors, October 28th meeting.
Expansions to the sewer water service area were approved.
That resulted in a net increase of about 335 acres into the sewer water service area of the Northeast land use plan.
This item before you is kind of a follow up that's been following just a little behind the original sewer water service area expansions.
There's been some discussion about those two areas that were originally left out of the kind of preliminary study.
So this is a public hearing for those two areas.
So you may recall we have area one, which is located west of interstate 81.
Jason to the eat out rest area.
Let me see in this red circle here.
For reference, for interstate 81 that runs along that you have this is proper area one and that little white blob is the rest area.
Two also located west of 81 north of Cedar Hill Road.
You see this area here.
Now you see on this map, this is the kind of the adopted new sewer water service area that was approved by the board recently.
And then these were those two areas that are currently planned for future industrial land use, but were not included with the first round of the Suaza.
These two areas if added to the Suaza would be about 308 acres.
So we won't go over really the history.
It's it's been kind of pretty much discussed in the past with all of the past actions with the compiling committee and the board and the work sessions.
So what we're seeking tonight is a recommendation from the planning commission to forward to the board of supervisors on the addition of these two acres of two areas for a total 308 acres into the Northeast land use plans.
I'll be glad to answer questions.
Anyone with questions.
We're Ms. Perkins.
See.
See none.
Well, these two catch up to each.
Well, these two, the one that's already been going through and this one when they combine into one eventually.
The first, I'll call it phase one, which was waverly and the first Northeast land use plan.
That's already been approved.
So that's already adopted into the comp plan.
So that's on the books now.
So this will just get.
If it's approved by the board, it'll just be incorporated into a new Suaza line.
So there'll be a one cohesive boundary.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is a public hearing.
And this time I'll open a public hearing for anyone that would like to come forward to speak for against this item.
Do you know one will close the public hearing?
There's even no further discussion.
No questions.
I'll entertain a motion from our Stonewall district.
Yes, sir.
2035 comp plan, Northeast land use plans to and water service area.
Or two additional areas.
Is that a motion?
Is that in the form of a motion, sir?
To approve?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
I have a motion to approve.
At the plan that amendment is presented tonight, I have a second.
I have a second.
I heard.
And I'll do a vote.
Mr. Molden.
Molden, yes.
Borsen, yes.
Dawson, yes.
Mone, yes.
Robert, yes.
Thomas, yes.
Daniel, yes.
Marston, yes.
Julie, yes.
And a chair vote, yes.
So this goes to with our approval to our November 12th.
Four supervisors meeting.
Thank you.
We go right to zip it through in this agenda.
And our next item is an item of other.
We have a next meeting is on the 18th, Mr. Reddy.
That's Craig, Mr. Chairman.
We'll have a meeting on the 18th, where we'll be reviewing a couple of messed-up development plans.
Obviously, they're primarily for information, but it should be of interest to the Planning Commission.
In addition, we'll have a resolution recognizing Mr. Mooma.
Thank you.
Appreciate that.
Well, I look forward to that.
Yet there's nothing else that anyone needs for the good of.
Everyone involved?
I'll entertain a motion to adjourn.
So moved.
All those in favor?
Aye.
We're adjourned.
I don't think it could be a new record.
That's right.
See you, Alfred.
