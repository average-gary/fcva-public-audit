Our next item moving right along is our committee reports.
And I think our first report would come from Mr. Marston,
from Frederick Water.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Frederick County Water Board of Directors met on the 20th
of this month, which was the last night at 5 p.m.
Had one on the thing on the agenda,
they authorised a change order number two
for the Swesky Water Treatment Plan.
The Frederick Water Board of Directors
authorised the insurance of change order number two
for the Opeca Water Supply Plan's
Swesky Water Treatment Plan.
This change confirmed the use of a membrane water treatment process
in the new plant,
and affirmed saving nearly $10 million on construction
of the water treatment plan.
The membrane treatment process became an extremely
cost-effective treatment process
once Frederick Water secured access
to the water storage and supply within the commos
east pit this past May.
The change order also establishes the completion
of the construction program
so that the Swesky Water Treatment Plan
will be operational on April of 2022.
I like these changes when it saves $10 million.
September Operations Report,
the customer base now is over 17,021 connections.
Monthly water production averaged
6.837 million gallons per day.
Right now the cores are still in excellent shape.
Water production, the James H. Steele plant,
2.99 million gallons a day.
James T. Anderson plant,
3.12 million gallons a day.
In the city of Winchester,
we purchased 0.727 million gallons per day.
And the rainfall in September was 4.21 inches
down from August at 6.12.
Mr. Chairman, that completes my report.
Thank you, sir.
The next report was historical resources, Mr. Muldin.
Yes.
The historical resource advisory board
met on Tuesday, October 20th at 6 p.m.
We reviewed the conditional use permit
for hollow road solar LLC,
conditional use permit project located
on two parcels of land,
totaling 236 acres.
Sites located at 806 hollow road
and Gore,
Back Creek Med Sterled District,
on the property,
27A11, 27A12.
There was significant historical significance found
on the property.
There are several structures that they would like to see saved.
And I think the applicant was on board with this.
They are going to start a phase one review of the
storex of this area.
But we are going to move this project forward
to the planning commission.
So that concludes my report.
Thank you, Mr. Muldin.
Appreciate it.
I don't see a Winchester plan in liaison
anywhere unless I miss them somewhere.
They had nine items on their agenda yesterday.
They may still be going on as we speak.
But they had a very long agenda.
I stopped in for a little bit yesterday there.
But I'll go to the board of supervisors liaison, Mr. Graber.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As you see before you this evening,
there are two things that are back in front of you
regarding the Swaza.
You guys had been so gracious to us and moved forward.
What we had originally asked for.
And once it got before us,
we decided or looked at it and saw there was some things
that we felt the two industrial sites that probably
should have been included.
So it's back before you guys for discussion and input
this evening.
Appreciate that.
Sorry that we have to bring it back to you twice.
Well, that's all right.
That's how we get it done.
That concludes unless I'm missing someone on the committee
reports.
That concludes our committee reports.
It does time.
Where we moved in our agenda,
we'll move to the resolution of appreciation,
honoring Mr. Lawrence, our Larry Embrogy,
member of the Planning Commission of Frederick County, Virginia.
Whereas, Larry Embrogy served as a Shawnee district representative
on the Frederick County Planning Commission
from the date of his appointment by the Frederick County Board of
Supervisors on January 23rd 2008 until his death on September 22nd,
2020.
And whereas Larry Embrogy served on various committees and
assignments of the Planning Commission, such as the Development Review
and Regulations Committee, where he was most recently the chairman.
And whereas during this period of his membership on the commission,
Larry Embrogy demonstrated both great insight into issues which
led to the commission and a keen sense of dedication to the
betterment of his community.
And whereas Larry Embrogy possessed the highest devotion to duty and
represented the citizens in the county with dignity, dedication,
wisdom and wit.
And whereas Larry was appointed as Commonwealth Attorney in 1968 and
was elected and served with distinction.
As Commonwealth Attorney for Frederick County, Virginia,
continuously from 1969 until his retirement in 2007 after 38 years of
service.
Whereas during his tenure as Commonwealth Attorney, Larry served
the Board of Supervisors as the county attorney for Frederick County
and whereas in 1998, Larry was presented with the Robert F.
Horan Jr. Award for the Virginia Association of Commonwealth
Attorneys for Outstanding Service to the citizens of the Commonwealth
of Virginia, the citizens of Frederick County and to the members of
the association.
And whereas the members of the Planning Commission wish to express their
gratitude to Larry Embrogy and to recognize his many years of
faithful service.
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Frederick County Planning
Commission extends its deepest sympathy to the family of Larry Embrogy,
a conscientious and respected public servant.
Be it further resolved that on this 21st day of October 2020,
the Frederick County Planning Commission does hear by a
fetch express its exterior thanks and appreciation for his
commitment to sound planning, his tireless participation,
and activities of the Planning Commission and his various subcommittees
and honors his life of leadership, dedication and contribution to the
County of Frederick.
Thank you.
It's very honorable to be able to read a resolution for a man
that's so well respected.
And I thank them for the privilege of doing so tonight.
Thank you.
So the next item on our agenda moving forward is our citizen
comment portion.
This is the portion of our meeting that anyone can come forward to
speak to us to anything that's not on our agenda tonight.
So if there's anyone that would like to come forward with any non-agenda
items, now is your time to come forward and speak.
Seeing no one, I'll close the citizen comments.
We'll move right to our first public hearing item, which is
CPPA number 01-20 for the Waverly Farm,
sewer and water service.
Mr. Chairman, I'll be recuse myself from this.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.
The Waverly Farm, Comprehensive Plan Amendment request,
is a request to expand the boundary of the sewer water service area.
The site is located west and adjacent to Interstate 81,
south of Hopewell Road in Stonewall,
and Magistral District.
I can direct you on the screen to your left.
You have Interstate 81, and then Hopewell Road,
and the subject properties are outlined in this blue color.
And the screen line here is the existing limits of the sewer water service area.
So the site is currently zoned R.A. Roll areas.
Now would note that the existing limits kind of that bubble of the Suaza
around the interchange totals about 51 acres.
Now the Northeast Land Use Plan shows the area inside the existing Suaza,
as well as the surrounding area of those current limits,
with a commercial, with a mixed-use industrial office,
land use, and then the rest of that area is shown with a future industrial.
So you can see the limits of the existing Suaza in that area,
kind of inside and outside of the current line.
And then this blue is the future commercial.
So this proposed sewer water service area amendment,
before you total 171 acres, it includes 13 properties.
Now I would note that the original request submitted by the applicant
was for 145 acres, however, through the process of being reviewed
to make a cleaner line for the Suaza.
As you can see, there's this little triangular area
that was included within those limits,
so it increased that total acreage.
And through the process, we did work with Frederick Water
to look at the sewer water service area boundary,
ensuring it could serve this property.
And this is the Frederick Water Map that was submitted,
as you can see, their proposed line also encompassed that area.
There is also some draft tax that would go into the appendix,
which is Northeast Land Use Plan.
It's some guiding tax regarding the sewer water service area for that area.
It really looks at the purpose and intent of the sewer water service area,
its relationship to economic development,
and that it also outlines the need for funding of infrastructure improvements
through private participation for future development.
So this has been before the planning commission,
the comp plan committee with three board supervisors,
planning commission work session.
Most recently, you may remember it came before you for discussion
at your October 7th meeting,
and then it went last week to the board of supervisors
where the board did send it forward to public hearing,
which is what we're here discussing tonight.
In conclusion, we're seeking a recommendation from the commission
to forward to the board of supervisors
on both the 171 acre expansion and the draft text.
Next.
Thank you. Any questions, Ms. Burkins?
Thank you.
This time I'll open the public hearing,
and if I'd like to come forward to speak for or about this item,
please come forward, state your name.
We're in your address.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the planning commission,
Supervisor Graber.
My name is John Riley, and I represent the styles family
with reference to this application.
I would like to note that we support the staff's position
on this particular application,
and we'll only add that the family has reached the end
of their tenure as far as dairy farmers.
There is no line of succession coming forward to try and help.
So what the family is attempting to do is to try and position
themselves as well as they can to market the property.
Obviously, they can't afford to re-zone it,
but they can put it on the market with such things as an adjusted
war and sewer service area, which will help them tremendously.
But I'd be more than happy to answer any of your questions,
and we would sincerely appreciate your support.
Thank you, Mr. Riley. Any questions, Mr. Riley?
And an applicant.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Anyone else would like to come forward to speak to this matter?
Seeing no one, I'll close the public hearing.
And we'll just go right into discussion, any discussion?
Questions?
Anyone?
I think we've added this one pretty well to the past few months.
So this time, I'll entertain a motion to move it forward.
Anybody would like to make a motion?
Chairman.
I move that we accept the way we farm water and sewer service area
at this time.
Second.
Second.
Okay, I'll start with Mr. Jew.
Yes.
First and yes.
Endure, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Moan, yes.
Dawson, yes.
Morrison, yes.
Moan, yes.
And Chair votes, yes.
So this motion is approved.
It goes to more supervisors on our October 28th meeting.
It's at the approval.
Thank you.
Next item, Ms. Perkins, again, is a public hearing item.
It's for Northeast land use plan, Nila.
Thank you, again, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.
This is a public hearing for the remainder of the Northeast
land use plan, sewer water service area adjustments.
This Swaza review really focused on the overall Northeast
land use plan limits and the limits of the sewer water service boundary
within that land use plan.
It looked at areas that have a current planned future land use,
but are not within the limits of the sewer water service area.
And it also looked at some of the property boundaries where the
area was aligned did not follow the property boundaries.
And I would note that the text that was part of the package for
the Waverly is also the same text that would apply to this
amendment as well.
So, and again, like we did coordinate this study with Frederick
Water to ensure that they could serve the areas proposed with
inclusion.
So Frederick Water did send forward their recommended Swaza
analysis in the 11 North corridor.
What their recommendations from their board stated was they
discussed removal of areas with planned land uses that would not
require public water and sewer addition of areas that would need
that public water and sewer to develop.
They noted the need for private investment in the sewer water
infrastructure for future development.
So, what they then proposed is the removal about a 681 acre
area, the addition of about 1,017 acres into the Swaza.
And that's for future planned business industrial land uses.
So, what they really showed was a net possible increase of
335 acres with their study.
So, just to kind of highlight the kind of the expansions and
reductions areas.
So, the first area for expansion, west of 81 south of the
West Virginia line.
It's north and south of rest church road.
So, you have the West Virginia boundary and you have rest
church road in 81.
So, it's this area right here around that current bubble line.
And then you have an expansion area east of 81 south of
West Virginia, east of Woodside Road and south of Grace
Church Road, which is this area right here.
And then this is the area that we just discussed previously,
the Waverly Farm.
And then your reduction area would be this area between this
green line, which is the existing Swaza and that blue line.
So, this really followed the same process of the Waverly Farm
amendment.
It went to your October 7th planning commission meeting and
then last week to the Board of Supervisors.
Yeah.
Just to discuss the Board of Supervisors at their October
14th meeting did send this study for the adjustments forward
for public hearing, which is what's before you tonight.
I would note that at that meeting they did also send a
public hearing in those two areas that were outside of the
boundaries that were not proposed during no for inclusion,
which as you can see is this area right here, which is adjacent
to the 81 rest area.
It's about 135 acres and then this area too, which is near
the Waverly.
So, that's going to follow kind of a little bit separate
process.
With this, we're kind of keeping this track together.
So, it'll plan to go to the Board of Supervisors for public
hearing.
And then this is going to come kind of on the heels of that.
It's scheduled for your November 4th meeting for public hearing.
So, it's just going to follow a little bit after so we can still
process these.
So, with that, we are seeking recommendation from the commission
on the removal and the addition of those areas as outlined.
I'd be glad to answer any questions.
Thank you, ma'am.
Any questions?
Ms. Perkins.
A hand.
Mr. Thomas.
Is the owner of the property the 600 acres it's being removed?
Did they have any comments?
It did submit a letter.
It is at your seats today.
It doesn't say one way or the other.
It's just a letter.
Right.
It did send a letter that about possibly participation in a
process.
They didn't really send a, I guess, a position either way.
Really, they did comments about this area that they do own north,
which is actually being included in the sewer water service area.
But they're area that they do own that's it's current land use is
extractive manufacturing, which does not require public water and sewer.
So.
That's correct.
Correct.
Any other questions, Ms. Perkins?
Thank you.
This is a public hearing.
This time I'll open a public hearing.
Anybody want to come forward to speak to this matter?
Please do so.
Anyone at all?
I see no one.
I'll close the public hearing.
Discussion?
Any questions?
I'll just make one comment again.
I know I made this before.
We keep saying that this is only a net increase of 300 some acres.
But really it's a net increase of a thousand acres because the 600 acres
was never going to use water and sewer anyhow.
So, I mean, looks good on paper saying 300 acres.
But the really the demand is ratting another thousand acres of demand,
of realistic demand.
We take and thank Ms. Thomas.
Anyone else?
Are there other uses in extractive mining that we've addressed?
I mean, are there other uses in that zoning designation?
I think there's numerous.
Ms. Perkins, you might want to answer that.
I think there's numerous other uses in there.
The zoning district really has very limited uses as far as the EM.
It's really kind of limited to the actual quarry, crushing, concrete type uses.
It's not very broad and it's all directly related to the mining use.
Any other questions?
With that, I'll entertain a motion.
I can move for approval of 2035 Comprehensive Plan North East,
land use plan to a water service area.
I have a second.
I have a second down here.
I'll start Mr. Molden.
Molden, yes.
Molden, yes.
Molden, yes.
Molden, yes.
Molden, yes.
Molden, yes.
Molden, yes.
Chair votes, yes.
Motion is approved.
It also goes to the Board Supervisors on October 28th meeting for public hearing.
Our next item, I have Mr. Klein in front of me for an ordinance amendment.
Backyard chickens in the RP District.
This could even be Mr. Chairman, members of the Planning Commission.
This is an ordinance amendment before you this evening for information discussion purposes.
And this is a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance to allow backyard chickens and chicken coops as a by right use in the RP residential performance zoning district.
This request for a zoning ordinance text amendment was initiated by a private citizen requesting it be considered through their board Supervisors representative.
Currently, the keeping of chickens is only allowed in the county's R.A., rural area zoning district.
And this amendment would allow single-family detached lots, 15,000 square feet, or greater, approximately 0.34 acres, to have up to a maximum of six chickens by right in the RP.
And because of the way the zoning ordinance works, also the R4 and the R5 zoning districts.
In addition to the considerations of the lot size and the total number of chickens that would be allowed.
We are proposing additional supplemental use regulations for backyard chickens to manage how the use would be implemented, including prohibited chickens in town homes, duplexes, multi-family buildings, garden apartments, and single-family detached lots less than 15,000 square feet.
We are proposing to provide prohibiting the keeping of roosters, turkeys, guineafowl and peacocks, following setback and building requirements for accessory structures for the coops, prohibited prohibiting the use in the front yard setbacks, and ensuring that the use is not visible from public or private road rights away.
The area designated for chickens shall be completely enclosed, and that no free range chickens would be allowed.
And requirements for secure feed storage and waste management.
And also that there be a requirement for an application and a permit with a $25 fee to Frederick County prior to the establishment of the use.
That even though we may amend the zoning ordinance, private covenants, homeowner association guidelines, they further restrict the keeping of backyard chickens and chicken coops and individual lots.
So the homeowner would need to be well aware of what their requirements are for their individual community before making that application to the county.
We had a review and regulations committee discussed the item on September the 24th, and we had quite a long discussion.
The primary topic for consideration by the committee was what the appropriate minimum lot size would be on lots where chickens may be allowed.
And after some discussions, the committee generally supported supported sorry a minimum lot size of 15,000 square feet, and a maximum of six chickens.
The committee and making that recommendation for the lot size stated that, you know, the purpose of this use is intended for hobbyist and personal use, not for commercial sale of eggs or meat, but for again, those people looking to have a couple of eggs, you know, pets, it's more of a hobby type activity.
That's why we kept it at six six chickens.
This item is presented to you all this evening for information or discussion in any comments from this discussion will be forwarded to the board of supervisors for their consideration at a later meeting.
And staff is happy to answer any questions you may have about this text amendment. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Klein. This is a discussion item, and that was our information. So anybody, any questions, any discussion?
Klein, the statement you made there, in other words, this ordinance wouldn't override an HOA by law ordinance or whatever HOA has.
In other words, if HOA says they can't have chickens, this ordinance doesn't.
Correct. Private. Private. Private. Private. Covernance and HOA restrictions.
Can further restrict otherwise allowed by the zoning ordinance.
Okay.
What else?
Straits.
Yeah, two questions. One, the $25 fees. I like it. All go out of sense words. Every year they have to pay $25 to keep up with enforcement.
I think it's intended to be a one time fee. The reason for making the reason for requiring an application is to understand how many people are out there doing this use.
And more importantly, providing a remedy to those cases where we've had violations of people keeping chickens in the RP district.
The remedy would be to apply for the permit to operate the use. It would not be an annual fee. It's currently not intended to be an annual fee. It's a one time fee.
Any circumstances we would understand who is doing this use and where it is located?
All right. Well, since we have basically 10 items on this to enforce it seems like that should probably be an annual fee like a dog license to keep up with enforcement.
The other question is you mentioned up there about the meat that was for eggs only.
So they're not allowed to kill their chickens for meat.
