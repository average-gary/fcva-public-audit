The Crossroads Community Church who will deliver our invocation, Pastor Alcher.
Thank you and Merry Christmas to each of you.
Thank you. Can we stand together as we pray?
Heavenly Father, I'm reminded of this passage from the prophet Isaiah,
if one to us a child is born to us the son is given and the government will be upon his
shoulders. And he will be called, wonderful counselor, mighty God, everlasting Father and
Prince of Peace. Another greatness of his government and peace that will be no end.
Father God, we thank you that you didn't call us to live alone or govern alone.
And I pray, Father, tonight that you would have gracious counsel upon this board of supervisors.
I pray, Father, that you would express yourself as a mighty God among those that are weak and can
express themselves, Lord. I thank you God that you're an everlasting Father for those that
are filling lonely during this season of year. And Lord, we thank you that you express
yourself as a Prince of Peace. And we pray that your peace would be upon our meeting
that act in conclusion of tonight that we would make decisions that would honor you and bless
this county in Jesus' name. Amen. Supervisor Wells, would you lead us interpretively?
I will. Please face the flag to you over to you right there.
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which
it stands, one nation under God, individual, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you, Supervisor Wells. And thank you, Pastor Alger.
Thank you, Pastor Augusto.
Adoption of the agenda. What is the pleasure of the board?
Mr. Chairman, I would move that we adopt the agenda with removing item 8A from the agenda.
Okay, we have a motion to approve the agenda with the removal of 8A,
which is the Shawnee land appointment. I mean, Shawnee appointment.
The second, second, Wells discussion. All those in favor? Second, Rob, say it. Aye.
Aye. Opposed? The agenda is adopted.
Let me, if I may, just make some remarks here before we start into the citizen comment period.
For those of you who don't know, the second amendment resolution has been placed on our
consent agenda, which comes up after the citizen comments. That consent agenda is generally made
up of items that are of regular issue, not open to debate, and also have basically the consensus
of the board members. So if you have signed up to speak, you may still speak, but keep
it in mind, again, that the second amendment resolution is on the consent agenda,
and that it will be voted on immediately after the citizen comment. So if you do not feel the
need to speak to that based upon that information, when your name is called, just please stand up and
say that you do not wish to speak at this time. As you can see, we've had a lot of people turn
out for this issue, and I want to thank everyone for coming out and expressing their interest
and showing their pages. But again, in order to have us go through the meeting so that it doesn't
drag on and people get tired and not get to stay for the part of the meeting that they had come
for. If it's other than that, if in fact you have signed up to speak, and after realizing that
the second amendment resolution is on the consent agenda, if you do not wish to speak,
please let us know when your name is called. So with that being said, we will open the
floor up for citizen comments. The Phillips is, you want to call the first names, and as we
call the names, I was supposed to call the first speaker up, and then also call the name of the
person after that. So you can be in line so we can keep the comments going.
Delicate, Dave Lerock, followed by Daniel Highland.
If you will give us your name, Magisterial District, and Limiter comments, the three-minute
or less, sir. Yes, well, Dave Lerock, I serve in the House of Delegates, 33rd House District,
which is parts of Frederick, Clark, and Loudoun counties. So thank you, Supervisor McCann,
Slaughter, Supervisor Wells, Supervisor Loft, and Supervisor Dunn for allowing me to speak.
I'm here to respectfully encourage you to make a strong statement regarding the board's position
on the bills coming before the Virginia State Legislature, which are threatening our fundamental
rights and understand that the resolution you have before you will do exactly that.
The Virginia Constitution and the United States Constitution are both very clear on this
fundamental right. The right to keep and bear our arms is a God-given constitutionally protected
right. Quoting our Constitution our Supreme Law of the Land, a well-regulated militia being
necessary to the security of a free state. The right of the people to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed. As you know, some state legislatures and our governor are saying that
they intend to pass some bad laws, laws which will violate our God-given rights to keep and bear
arms. After six years in the Virginia House of Delegates, I can assure you that they intend to keep
those promises, and they are now in power and have the ability to do that. That is why it is very,
very important that this legislature hear from bodies like this as they're hearing from other
boards across the Commonwealth, and that the statements be strong. I think the statements that
are being released are very appropriate, very proper, and again, I encourage you to join them.
There is a bright side to this. This is a very peaceful movement, this movement that you see
among us here today. I think it is saying that these are anti-gun bills, like these red flag laws,
are illegitimate, and that they will not be tolerated. So I thank you to this board for adding
considering, adding your voice, along with the tens of thousands of Virginia who have already spoken
up in protest, anticipating this overreach. I hope to go to Richmond in a couple of weeks to
communicate with other lawmakers where we stand in this area. Board members, ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming to speak tonight. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.
I hope that after the vote is taken tonight and after you hear from these other people
that you will give me instructions and a strong directive to go to Richmond and let them know
that we will not sit idle while they violate our constitutional rights. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Daniel Highland, followed by Cory O'Donnell.
Sir, please give us your name and match to our district and in the image comments three minutes or less.
Sir, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this evening. My name is Daniel Highland,
Gainesborough's my district. I don't have much to add in terms of the decision that's going to be
made later on this evening, but I do want to share my voice as one of the citizens of this county.
About a year ago, an Ann Arndell County Maryland, a 60-year-old man named Gary Willis woke up at 5.17am
because someone was pounding on his door. It was still long before dawn and he went to the door
with his gun and was shot in his own doorway by two county police officers who had come to his
house on the grounds of red flag gun confiscation laws passed in Maryland earlier that year.
It seems that every time there is a shooting at a business or a school in this country,
some fear-mongering politicians begin pushing for laws to restrict weapons that were not used in
the shooting and to enforce restrictive gun policies in their own states and counties,
similar to those that for the most part were already in place in the states and counties where
these shootings occur. Following the recent election, our state representatives in Richmond are
attempting to pass the same kind of legislation for Virginia, but these laws do not make anyone safer.
They only leave communities vulnerable to violent citizens and to violent government officials,
but I do not believe that these laws will have any force in Frederick County, even if they are
passed, or that they will have any force throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia because I do not
believe the citizens will comply. Our Board of Supervisors will not comply. I trust that Sheriff
Moholand and his officers will not comply because these laws aim to violently restrict the peaceful
exercise of our rights guaranteed under the United States Constitution. The Constitution is a
higher law than any laws passed in Richmond and they answer to the Constitution not the other way
around. Even the Constitution does not grant us the right to keep and bear arms. We already have
this right, that is why it is a right not a privilege that can be given or taken away. The
Constitution simply acknowledges our God-given rights as human beings and we will continue to
exercise these rights no matter what violence or penalty is threatened against us because a
people that has surrendered its rights is a people that is vulnerable and enslaved. That is
truly what is a stake in this discussion. These attempts to destroy American liberty and
endanger American citizens must stop here and I know that the citizens of Frederick County will
remember who in our local and state governments chose to defend our rights and who chose to attack
them. This is not a stunt. Gary Willis is dead. He doesn't live in his house in Arndell County
anymore. He will not be a Christmas with his family this year. They will never see him or speak to
him again because the people of Maryland allowed their states government to strip them of their rights
and terrorize them into submission but that will not happen in Virginia and it will not happen
in Frederick County. There is no reason for that kind of violence to take place here and there will
be no reason for it until the day that our representatives choose to attempt to use force against
their own citizens to restrict us in the peaceful exercise of our rights. Thank you.
If I may, sir, to all the participants, thank you very much. I know that speakers are going to
come up here speaking with passion and speaking to the issue that you came here but if you would hold
your applause so that we would be able to continue to hear these speakers as they want to present
their case, it would make things go much faster. So thank you and again, I won't say at every time
but every speaker, if you would just come up, give your name, state your magistrate district and
limit your comments to three minutes or less, so that would be great. Thank you. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Good evening. My name is Cory O'Donnell. My district is Gainesboro. On November 15th, I formed a
petition to gather the support of Frederick County members to make a pass resolution to make
Frederick County, Virginia, a second amendment sanctuary county. I stand before you today with
over 7,000 signatures that were handwritten or signed online from members of our second amendment
community and members of the community that may not fully use and utilize their second amendment
rights specifically but wholeheartedly support the constitution of the United States.
I am here to represent the members of Frederick County and to show that not just I,
but thousands of residents would like to strongly urge you to adopt a resolution to make Frederick
County a second amendment sanctuary county. The proposed bill SB 16 would make thousands of
law-abiding governors including myself, felons just by owning an assault firearm. As Monday of
this week, Governor Northam is instituted a grandfather clause which also states that each firearm,
assault firearm, that was purchased before this bill shall be given a grace period to be registered.
Governor Northam does not seem to understand how to read the law particularly as the Fire
Arm Protection, Owners Protection Act of 1986 guarantees that no state or county registrate
can form a registry of the guns on firearms and that ties firearms to their owners. We will not
take compromise. This is a bill to enact gun safety. It is a bill that aims to confiscate our
firearms. These assault firearms are not just gun-rained sporting rifles. There are many
citizens that use these type of firearms for the way of life whether it be they teach classes
and how to properly and safely use these firearms or whether it be the farmers that protects their
crops and cattle from various animals and destroy their terrorized their livelihood.
From weekend gun enthusiasts to firearms to our owners across the state and country,
this bill would adversely affect many citizens of the Commonwealth. SB 16 is an absolute
infringement of the U.S. Constitution Second Amendment and Article 1 Section 13 of the Virginia
State Constitution. I encourage you today that you please help us defend our rights until the
lawmakers enrichment that we will not stand for such injustices. This county was founded by men
who took to arms and gained freedom and liberties from a tyrannical government and now we are
losing those freedoms and liberties every election. I for one will not stand for this type of
government ovuration. I will do everything I can to fight back against it. Now more than ever we
must stand together unified and protect our constitutional rights and the God given right we have
to protect ourselves however we do see fit. Thank you for your time this evening and I would like to
say thank you to everyone and every member of the community that came out this evening that I
count and support the second member right. Thank you. I can see one time.
Jason Vance. Jason Vance followed by Brian Nuri. Thank you.
Good evening supervisors my name is Jason Vance. I live in the red butt district of the county.
I am a lifelong resident of Virginia, born and raised in Winchester and as I say now residing in
the county. I work in the bail bonds industry and I am also a department of criminal justice license
fire arm instructor. I have also spent over 34 years employed by the Department of Treasury as
an information technology specialist but my most important job is keeping me and my loved ones safe.
These proposed gun laws not only violate the second, fourth, fifth and sixth amendments of the
Constitution of the United States but they also put me at a very bad disadvantage of trying to
do my job because you know who doesn't care about these gun laws. The very people that are the
most dangerous to the safety of me and my loved ones. The ones that don't seem to be worried about
any law. The ones that don't care that it may be illegal for them to have a magazine in their
fire arm that holds more than 10 rounds while they're invading my home. The ones that enter gun
free zones with evil and hatred in their hearts intent on slaughtering innocent people in an area
where a law abiding gun owner is unable to defend themselves. A gun is a tool in an animate object
just as a knife just as a hammer or a car. It is also the choose tool that I choose to do my job.
The right to possess this tool is guaranteed to keep me by both the United States and Virginia
Constitution. Allow legal gun owners to possess the proper tools to defend ourselves, our
loved ones. That to me is a common sense gun law. Please don't expend county resources enforcing
these unreasonable, unconstitutional laws. Governor Northam and March vetoed two immigration bills
that would abandon sanctuary city policies and required local law enforcement agencies to notify
immigration officials of when doggy-minute immigrants. His explanation for this wasn't I quote,
the safety of our communities requires that all people, whether they are documented or not,
feel comfortable, supported, and protected by our public safety agencies.
Well, Governor, I hate to tell you, I'm not just a person, I'm a lifelong citizen and with this
proposed legislation, I feel neither comfortable, supported, nor protected by not only public safety
agencies, but my government as well. Thank you for your time and God bless.
Good evening. Thank you very much, Vice Chairman. My name is Brian Nuri,
I'm a resident of the OPEC in district. Tonight you're going to hear, as we already have,
a lot of speculation and assumption and general fear-mongering. What you're not going to hear too
much about anything at all is about upholding the rule of law, more specifically the Dylan rule.
Now, what is the Dylan rule? Everyone has been asking this for so long and everyone gets
confused. Well, Blacks Law Dictionary defines it as a doctrine that a local government may only
exercise the powers that the state expressly grants to it and the powers that are indispensable
for the existence of the unit of local government. This is the legal principle known as ultravieres,
the beyond the scope of the powers. So let's look into this more closely by examining the two
clauses of that doctrine. One, has Frederick County or any other locality for that matter been
granted permission to selectively ignore laws from Richmond? No. According to David J. Jones of Norfolk,
the legal precedent we would set by allowing communities to selectively ignore laws that will
be alarming. He goes on to say that if the duly elected general assembly passes measures to
advance gun safety in the Commonwealth, I believe the legislature should be able to do so without
actions by localities to undermine its efforts. Two, does this resolution promote or create a
power indispensable to the existence of local government? No. According to Article 5 of the Virginia
Constitution, the role of the governor and by extension the law enforcement officers under his
command is to faithfully execute the law. Article 6 explains that the role of the judiciary is to
interpret and prosecute the law. With this resolution, you're asking our sheriffs to become lawyers
by giving them the ability to interpret and selectively ignore the laws that they feel are
unconstitutional. That is in and of itself unconstitutional. They would impose upon the roles of the
Commonwealth's attorneys and the judges as the interpreters of the law resting from them the
prosecutorial discretion as well as making judicial review by the Supreme Court of Virginia pointless.
Let's not forget that this is all moot to begin with because as he so-called laws
are merely bills filed with the state, no committee has been convened, no debate has occurred,
certainly no laws have been signed by the governor. This dilatory motion is simply political
theater drummed up by the NRA and the Virginia Civil Defense League.
You think about it now? What are what are the Dylan rule was last invoked by this
board to rescind an anti-discrimination policy as a local delegate warned them that the policy
would run afoul of the Dylan rule and of state law. It would follow then that the same
supervisors who voted to rescind that policy would be the ones to vote against this resolution
even being considered on the consent agenda. So it's to waste less of this board's time on matters
of presumption. Thank you. Molly Brandon. Thank you. Molly Brandon followed by Steve Brandon.
My name is Molly Brandon. I'm from the Stonewall District. Not an attorney. I'm not a
legislator. I'm just a citizen of the county that want my protection. I heard he's talking about
you don't have a right to do this. Does the state of the Virginia have a right to take away my
constitutional right to protect myself? I also want to comment that I hear Democrats talking about
guns are just for malicious. Well if we look back in our history there's a reason the Japanese
stopped at Pearl Harbor. They didn't want to come across the country because we were all armed
when our military was on these coasts. There's a reason the Germans didn't go into Sweden. It wasn't
because they were isolationists and not get involved. It's because all of those citizens were
issued rifles and they didn't want to face the citizenship. Having guns by the people protects
people. It keeps bad armies, bad people, criminals. There's a reason gun shootings are in gun-free zones
because there's no one there to protect them. There's a reason things happen on airplanes
because we're not allowed to protect ourselves. Don't make federal county citizens
just sitting ducks for criminals and bad people and rich men that want to take away our rights. Thank you.
Thank you, Brandon, followed by James Maynard.
Good evening. Thank you for this opportunity. Supervisors. My name is Steve Brandon and I currently
live in the Redbud district. My wife and I have lived in Virginia for 23 years and we moved
here and have continued to live in the Commonwealth for a variety of reasons including
our ability to enjoy the sport of shooting and the ability to defend ourselves up until now
about the state and this county have seen the wisdom in supporting firearm ownership. Unfortunately,
it appears that our rights and our liberties are about to come under fierce assault in Richmond.
I therefore urge you to support the motion to declare Frederick County a second amendment sanctuary
county. I have many reasons for encouraging you to cast this vote including some of them which
have already been stated. I'll just mention a few others. First laws passed by Richmond politicians
restricting use and ownership of firearms will do nothing to stop criminals from possessing or
using firearms. They will, however, force lawful gun owners to decide if they will surrender lawfully
acquire firearms or become felons. Second, many of these laws are aimed at so-called assault weapons
that FBI statistics prove that the use of rifles to commit murder including so-called assault weapons
have fallen since the expiration of the 1994-2004 federal assault weapons ban. In fact,
such murders have fallen to near historic lows of only 2.18% as of 2018. Third, gun owners as
a group commit less crime than the average citizen and have in fact stopped numerous crimes,
including mass shootings, disarming them will only lead to an increase in crime and deaths. For
example, in February of this year, dental hygienist Sabrina Steele was working with appeared to be a
normal day at her office. That changed suddenly when the husband of a co-worker pulled the firearm
and shot his wife dead. Thankfully, a concealed carry permit holder was also in the office,
which was not a gun-free zone. He was able to stop the shooter and hold him until a law enforcement
arrived. The hygienist later recalled that after the shooter fatally wounded her co-worker,
he, quote, raised the gun to shoot me. The county sheriff later said that the man who stopped
the shooting was a concealed carry permit holder and I'm going to call him a hero today.
In August of 2018, an armed citizen happened to be at a crowded back-to-school event with over
100 people in attendance, including children, when shots were fired. An armed citizen shot and
disabled the gunman. Deputy Chief Todd Hutchison later said, we are extremely grateful that nobody
else was injured in this incident. This could have been much worse. One witness said that he was
grateful that the armed citizen was in the right place at the right time. In contrast to these stories,
many points of the tragic shooting of Virginia Beach this past July as a reason for additional
restrictions on firearms. What you frequently do not hear, however, are two key facts. First,
that the shooting occurred in a gun-free zone. Second, that one of the 12 victims intentionally
left her firearm at home that day so that she would comply with the law, even though she had
expressed concerns with her husband that the gunman was dangerous. No one can know she may
have changed the outcome, but at least the victims may have had a chance. Finally, many of the
restrictions under the consideration of Richmond will violate the U.S. Constitution and the
Constitution of our great commonwealth. I urge you to support the resolution to make Frederick
County a Second Amendment in Sanctuary County. Thank you for your time.
James Maynard, followed by Elijah Philbert.
Good evening. James Maynard, James Broad District. I'd like to thank you guys for
accommodating us today, giving us the opportunity to voice our concerns. Let's get right to the point,
mass shootings. That's the reason these newly elected legislators are trying to pass all these laws.
Let's talk about that. Specifically, those who carry out these attacks. Aside from the obvious
severe mental issues, these people have one thing in common. They're cowards. They prefer unarmed
victims. That's why 98% of these horrific acts occur in gun-free zones because responsible
gun owners obey the law. These monsters are met with little to no resistance. However,
noble the intentions, firearm restrictions put innocent people in danger. Right now,
firearm sales are growing exponentially. Americans are purchasing guns at an estimated rate of
1 million per month. Despite the expiration of the National Firearms Act and the fact that Americans
now own 46% of the world's firearms, violent crime is down. 51% to be exact over the last 20 years.
Property crime is down over the United States in the same timeframe. Those are FBI numbers, not a
guess. Having that information would take some serious mental gymnastics to come to the conclusion
that guns in the hands of law-abiding citizens are the problem. These proposed laws will do
nothing to stop criminals. Arbitrary restrictions on magazine capacity will not prevent the next
shooting. In fact, these laws will help them. They will guarantee softer targets. They will
deprive us of the law-abiding citizen of the capability to defend ourselves against the very
threat these legislators claim to care so much about. These laws will make us law-abiding citizens
felons overnight. We will not stand for it. We will not compromise. We will not comply. We will not
register our firearms. We will not surrender our firearms. And we will not tolerate any assault
on our right to keep them. Thank you. Elijah Philbert, followed by Alan Morrison.
Elijah Philbert, Stonewall District. So thank you for offering me the opportunity to speak
tonight. I want to start by saying that per the 10th amendment, no state has the power to
legislate the 2nd amendment or any other law expressly stated in the Constitution. Virginia
cannot legislate something that's already been explained in the Constitution and laid out for us.
This is not include a number of other amendments that would be violated by proposed red flag laws.
James Madison, among other founding fathers, refused to sign the Constitution unless the bill of
rights was included. For Virginia Democrats to violate numerous rights in the bill of rights would
mean that Virginia is essentially repealing the ratification of the Constitution in this state,
since they would no longer recognize numerous constitutional rights granted to us by our creator.
Additionally, the Supreme Court case of Marbury V. Madison stated, and I quote,
all laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are null and void and that every law consistent with
the Constitution will have been made in pursuance of the powers granted by it. Every user
patient or law repugnant to it cannot have been made in pursuance of its powers. End quote,
that alone should be enough to keep our constitutional rights out of the hands of the Democrats
and Richmond. Lastly, in the Supreme Court case of DCV Heller, just as Antonin Scalia clearly
elaborated on the meaning of the Second Amendment and how militia is that of all able-bodied citizens,
not the National Guard, as they are a branch of the military controlled by the government.
As stated in the Second Amendment itself, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed. Nothing in that state except AR-15s or except high capacity magazines.
If the First Amendment applies to advancing technology such as TV, radio, social media,
then so does the Second Amendment in regards to advancing weapon technology. That's all I have
to say and I hope you'll make the right decision. Thank you.
Good evening, Supervisors. Over 200 Allen-Morson Gainesburg District. Over 228 years ago,
our Constitution and our former government was established, not from good old boys coming back from
a hunting trip, but from men who had just endured four years of horrific war to secure our freedoms
and deliver us from the tyranny of an oppressive government. These men suffered blood,
loss of wealth and property and loss of life to bring us this gift. Let us not now throw it away.
The arguments for removing our rights are typically all false and misleading and will never
solve any of the problems that are claimed. How does taking away the rights of the honest citizen
deter crime when it is decriminal and the unstable who are the culprits? How does violating the
fundamental basis of our rights as guaranteed by the Constitution create an improvement?
Spencer, by many that this resolution has no meaning, as of this morning, 78 localities in Virginia
have already taken such action and many more have already been working on it tonight.
Our governor has felt the pressure and has offered a compromised grandfather clause
and is when people remain silent when these kind of things are happening.
That government feels emboldened to act contrary to the law.
This is only a pretext to take away even more of our rights and our liberties one step at a time
until we will all be merely surfs of socialist overlords and no longer citizens.
The so-called compromise offered by the governor is nothing more than a way to create
an illegal gun registration process again in opposition to all existing laws but state and federal.
Look around the room tonight. If these people were the problem makers, you would have found that long ago.
It's not the object that causes the crime but the heart of the person that causes the problem.
Removing our ability to protect ourselves will only encourage further abuses by those in
ten on evil and from a new tyrannical government itself. We talked about the Dylan rule the night
but however when the liberals want to ignore state law like they do in sanctuary cities, it's okay.
Our own sheriff has said he will not enforce immigration laws unless a specific local
ordinance has been violated in the Winchester Star. So following the same logic we can do as you
see best tonight until our citizens in our county violate our existing laws we're safe from all of this.
Have a good evening and appreciate your efforts. Thank you.
Rudy Poe Ruggles followed by Clarence Mullins.
Good evening. My name is Rudy Poe Ruggles. I am of the Ainsboro District. I cannot add a lot
nor speak more eloquently to this issue than many men and ladies have already spoken to you about
this evening. I will add one thing. A great Virginian once said firearms are second only to the
Constitution in importance. They are the teeth of the people's liberty. That Virginian was George
Washington. Thank you.
Thank you.
There's Mullins followed by Sylvia White.
My name is Clarence Mullins. I'm with the Canesboro District.
Thanks for letting me speak. Well I heard a lot of stuff in here this evening. A lot of people
went through a lot of it. I just read an article here a few minutes ago, Mr. Norton. This includes
all the sheriffs and everybody sitting on the board. Hayesbury much said if you don't follow this
then everybody is going to get in trouble. So that was just a recent article I read. But you know
what? We're going to stand up. We're going to fight against this and we're going to let him know
that we're not going to take a sudden down. Thank you guys. Thank you.
Sylvia White followed by Rudy Hughes. Hello. My name is Sylvia White and I live in the
a pack in district. Sorry I just moved here. So I'm not super sure that's anything.
And I want to thank you for the opportunity to speak and I also want to thank everyone. Well
probably shouldn't have turned around. But I want to thank everyone for coming out what we're
doing here today is very powerful. So thank you for all your support. I'm a terrible speaker
so this will be quick I'm sure. A firearm is a force equalizer. It is often said that God
made man while Samuel Colt made man equal. As a female I recognize the importance of firearms
as a force equalizer and I recognize the importance of having the right firearm available for use.
Unfortunately many of the proposed laws seek to outlaw exactly that type of weapon that
that may be most user friendly for a female to defend herself and our loved ones.
Especially with the case of multiple attackers. But I speak to you as more than just a woman tonight.
I also speak to you as a career paralegal who specializes in firearms law and who often sees
otherwise law abiding people thrown into the legal system that often looks anything but just.
Laws like the ones proposed will not stop real criminals. Laws like the ones proposed will not
stop the type of people that I fear. Laws like the ones proposed only have the effect of punishing
the average citizen who fails or refuses to give up his or her rights. Why are we punishing the law
abiding public for the actions of a few criminals? Why are we focusing on demonizing weapons used
statistically insignificant number of crimes but owned by a substantial portion of the population?
Why will we turn people who have followed the laws all their lives into felons overnight?
Why are we attacking or right our own state constitutions as clearly should not be infringed upon?
We have an obligation to push back against unconstitutional and illegal laws. If sanctuary cities
are appropriate response sanctioned by governor Northam for immigration issues that may affect
those illegally in the country, then I say sanctuary counties are absolutely the appropriate
response for an attack on the rights of hundreds of thousands of law abiding Virginians.
For these reasons I ask that you pass the two a sanctuary resolution. Thank you for your time.
Sobri Hughes followed by Travis Dodson.
Good evening. My name is Roger Hughes. I'm from the Stonewall District.
There's a lot that I had planned to say that's already been said tonight so I'm not going to take
too much of your time. Essentially the United States was founded upon the ideology of individual
responsibility and personal liberty. The Bill of Rights and the Constitution were drafted
as a framework for the government to seek to protect those for us. The government is not here
to protect us. That is our own individual responsibility. When I joined the military I took an oath
to protect the Constitution and that includes the Bill of Rights and that includes the Second Amendment
because the Second Amendment is what holds back everything from eroding the rest of the Bill of Rights
and what the Constitution means to us as Americans when I got out of the military that
was stayed with me. I still to this day deep down in my heart and soul believe that the Bill of Rights
is more important than anything else and we need to protect that including the Second Amendment.
That's all I'd say. Thanks sir. Travis Stockson followed by John Ferraro.
Hello Board of Supervisors. My name is Travis Stockson owner of Middletown Firearms and also
a Shawnee district. I would like to show my support for our Second Amendment and urge the
Frederick County Board of Supervisors to make us a sanctuary city or county or tax dollars
and resources should not go to any activity limiting our Second Amendment. I would like to express
to you the negative impact these proposed gun laws would have on local businesses. I personally
have had over one million dollars in sales this past year. Restricting firearms I'm allowed the
purchase and sell would result not just in loss of revenue but loss in tax dollars for the county.
There's already one local gun shop closing its doors at the end of this year and that these
laws pass more could be forced to close. These are local small businesses that have served our
community for years. Middletown Firearms sells many types of firearms including military, sporting,
hunting and protection. We provide an educational resource in the community when firearms knowledge
and safe handling. We believe in the community. We purchase what we can locally and continue to
give back to our community. Limiting what we sell could not only hurt sales but potentially
crush our ability to operate. National distributors would not send me state banned products even if we
are named a sanctuary county. As a small business owner I'm providing for my family and jobs
for my employees. We would not be able, we would not be the only business to suffer but these
restrictions may force me to cut jobs or eventually shut my doors. We will not run. Myself and many
law abiding citizens in our state will automatically be considered felon simply because of a firearm we
have and continue to own. The word felon won't mean the same to many of us after our king imposes
these unjust restrictions or a constitutional right. Briefly I'm going to change the subject.
Briefly I would like to bring up another topic three years ago. My sister was shot in Winchester.
A bullet exited less than two inches from her spine. The shooter fled the scene. He was giving
one year for what he did. He has had many convictions, phone convictions, domestic violence,
burglary threat theft. I'm amazed that such a violent criminal was not locked up for longer
to prevent further crimes. We have a criminal problem. Disarming law abiding citizens is not
the way to fix this. Firearms or baseball bat. If someone in our state wants to hurt somebody
else they will find a way. Please vote with our law abiding citizens and patriots of the
Frederick County to make our county a sanctuary. Thank you very much.
Followed by Abe wine. Hello I'm John for our back Greek district and I didn't prepare a speech.
I just came here to speak from the heart almost 28 years ago. I took an oath of enlistment
before entering the Marine Corps to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States and
I still hold that oath very sacred. Just like you who are elected officials, whether it be here
in February County at the state level or at the federal level, we people expect you all to
honor your oath. For years it's been eroded and the Second Amendment has been under attack.
Continuously eroding our rights to keep and bear arms for the law abiding citizens.
I ask that you vote with the populace to allow us to keep that right because it is something that
is guaranteed to us. I have a rhetorical question too for the officers I don't expect an answer
but just based on the testimony tonight putting the ball in their court in a rhetorical question
out to them would they be willing after hearing the testimonies and the speeches tonight to go
door to door risking their lives risking the fact that maybe they won't be able to go home
and see their families again risking their personal safety that we would comply with these
unconstitutional laws. Thank you for your time.
Abe Wein.
My name is Abraham Wein. I reside in the Gainesboro district.
I guess I'm better known as Abe Wein from the History Channel show Truck Night in America.
I was born and raised here in Winchester, Virginia.
With that being said the show I was a part of was aired in over 20 countries and my ugly mug has
actually been viewed by more than 20 million people around the world. I don't tell you that to
impress you or to think I'm better than anyone. I tell you that because while filming the
In the Second season I wore short a shirt similar to this that said defend the second.
I never disarm not having an image of a firearm on it. In that episode when it aired
only my shoulders up was shown in that episode. Anytime my shirt was shown it was
non-invoid it was blurred out they spent thousands of dollars to blur that shirt out despite
the positive response to the show. With that being said I also know what it's like to lose.
I loved one due to quote unquote gun violence. My cousin Michael Shirley was killed here in
Freddie County, Virginia 30 minutes in the 2012 when he years eve. He was shot at point blank
range by a single shot. Now the reason I bring that up is because the legislation that is being
introduced in the Richmond would have not saved my cousin's life. It was not due to high
magazines or an insult weapon. It was done with a pistol. So none of these laws and
legislations going to affect what I've had any change of outcome for my cousin's life.
I know there's talks either way. I don't care if you're Democrat or Republican. I don't care
what side you're on. I honestly don't. I don't care where your political alliance lies. I just
ask that you will take this measure seriously. As you can see there's many citizens that care
deeply about it. I ask that you do make Freddie County a sanctuary county because despite my
appearance I am not a felon or criminal. I would really like to keep it that way. So please,
if you don't mind, make us a sanctuary county. Thank you very much for your time.
Sean Beard followed by Craig Anderson.
Well, my name is Sean Beard. I live in the Shawnee district and outside of a three-year period
living abroad for school. I'm a lifelong resident of Virginia. I'm either a request you pass
a resolution declaring Freddie County a sanctuary county for the second amendment. I know that
I know as many people here know that being a sanctuary county is more of a symbolic gesture
than it is a safeguard from prosecution from the gun builds that may make their way into law.
But it is a powerful symbol and a powerful message which I believe has already been heard
by some of the lawmakers in Richmond. I've hunted and used firearms recreationally just about
my entire life. More recently I've gotten engaged in competitive shooting and even coach a youth
competitive shooting team. But I speak to you not as a hunter or recreational shooter. I speak to
you today as a private citizen who is here to advocate for the real reason the founding fathers
installed the second amendment into our constitution and that is the ability of the people
comprised of individuals to be able to have sufficient means to defend themselves,
their families, their property, their community, and if need be their nation from potential
enemies either foreign in nature or from in the form of a tyrannical government. I want to
read just a few quotes from some of our founding fathers so that we can see what they were thinking
when they wrote the second amendment. George Mason asked in a debate I asked sir what is the
militia it is the whole people except for a few public officials he also would say to disarm the
people that was the best and most effectual way to enslave them. Samuel Adams once said
that the constitution shall never be construed to authorize congress to infringe against the
just liberty of the press or the rights of conscience or to prevent the people the United States
who are peaceable citizens from keeping their own firearms. Thomas Jefferson would say what country
can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that their people
preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms. The right to keep and bear arms enshrined
in the second amendment and the constitution of Virginia is not about hunting or sporting
but about the very preservation of the life of the way of life we hold dear. I respectfully
join my fellow citizens and request that you vote to resolve Frederick County, Virginia as a
sanctuary county for the second amendment. May God bless our county, state and the United States of
America. Craig Anderson. Craig Anderson followed by Cleo Usman.
Yeah Craig Anderson I am a Warren County resident but I come through here and do a lot of
shopping up shopped at Middletown firearms and go to the gun shows. It does impact economy.
That's not the biggest thing. This sanctuary city thing sounds a little fishy to me. I never
did like it but it's been working for the leftists. Somehow there's a work around. I'm not a lawyer
but you know you can get past that. They love it to not turn anybody into ice and then they let
them go and we hear they rape again and it's working for them. They do that for the vote. You get the
they know that the uneducated from other countries going to go for the free stuff baby part
he called Democrats. So it's working for them. We're probably doomed anyway because once you get
the demographic shift where it's nothing but uneducated people they're going for the free stuff
baby like they did in Venezuela. The left you know that is their plan and so pretty terrifying
but you guys can get around that and we got it we got to try our best and I do appreciate you
listen and do me. Thank you. Cleo you spoke about Theresa Moyers. Cleo? Yes.
I'm just going to say if you stand in front of microphone pull it down too. You can pull it down.
You're right there. There you go. I almost want to turn around and talk to everybody else here
because you know you already made up your votes. You already made up your votes. Cleo from
a peck one and I think I just want to say I support the Second Amendment. I also support
mom's demand action and that there are things that do need to change and I feel bad that so many
people are so scared here because that's what I'm seeing from this reaction in the crowd is that
people are fearful and I think that you pander to that with what you're going to be doing with
this that there are no laws that have even come out of Richmond and I always support everybody's right
to you know work your reps, write your postcards, call up you know push for the things that you want.
I would like you to not do this resolution because I don't think that we need it.
That's all I have to say that I do appreciate everybody being here and support your rights to
push your agenda just like I want to push mine and I support mom's demand action. Thank you.
Teresa Moears followed by James Evans.
Hi my name is Teresa Moears. I'm from Gainesboro District. It was hard for me growing up.
I was traumatized by somebody who wasn't supposed to have a gun in their hands.
I was playing with one of my friends and this gentleman looks at her, says you know I could kill
you right now. We didn't know what to do. The gentleman pulls up the gun, shots are right there
in front of us. The felon that wasn't supposed to have a gun. I was traumatized for years. I never
got to see my best friend again because this person that wasn't supposed to have a gun, he got it
anyway. For years I was traumatized. I couldn't hold a gun in my hand. I wasn't able to look at a
gun. But after meeting my husband, he worked with me for years and years to come. Now I have my
concealed weapons permit. I am petrified now today because of the way the world is to go anywhere
without my weapon. Do you never know when you go to a stop sign? Is that door going to come open?
Is somebody going to hurt me? I have four beautiful grandkids that I protect and if you take our
rights from us, who's going to be there to protect them? Because you can't be with us every second
of the day. We are the ones that are there to protect them. And if we don't have our weapons and
we don't have some way to protect them, what are we going to do at Walmart? What are we going to do
when we go to the CBS? We can't have an officer stand with us 24 hours a day. It's our job
to help our families and to help your families. If your families was in that position,
I would be honored to pull my weapon out to protect your kids, your husbands, your wives, your family.
And I really hope that you all decide to stand up for our rights as citizens. Thank you.
Good evening. I'm not an orator. I'm barely speaking English really. A little bit of Hickenees,
but I do want to say- Sir, if you give us your name- Sir, your name and register- I'm sorry.
My name is James Evans. I'm on Back Creek District. I apologize. I grew up in an abusive home.
I wasn't always six foot two, four hundred and twenty five pounds. My mom is just a little frail
thing. She's five foot three. She's small. And she used to get beat on a regular basis.
And every time that I would get grounded, a baseball bat or a honey knife or a pellet right for
a- we wouldn't let it have a gun. And it was always a weapon that we'd get taken away. I would
never lose the baseball glove or the baseball just a bat because you'd worry, mount with it if you
had it. Well, after five years, we finally got him out of the house. And I went and bought a gun.
And he tried to come back in the house. You know, he was smoothing mom, you know, like like
guys like that or, you know. And I just nonchalantly said, hey, I got a 12 gauge now in the house.
So I went and traveled on the other day. He left. He didn't start that- I almost said a bad word,
excuse me. He didn't start that again.
Tyranny doesn't like people that they want to step over to have weapons. And that told me that
less in a hard way. I'm a little smarter than when I look, thank God. And I've been reading some
of these things that these people want to impose. And it isn't the NRA trying to fear monger or
anybody else. It's the very politicians that got elected. That's doing the fear mongering.
Nothing's been passed. You all are 100% correct. They're trying. It's things like what we're trying
to do that'll stop it. And I hope you all do what needs to be done. Thank you.
Whitney De Haven. Whitney De Haven followed by Ian Antoni.
I'm Whitney De Haven and I am from the Gainesboro District. I have lived in Virginia my whole life.
I am a six year Frederick County resident now. And everybody has said everything you need to
hear. I'm speaking for the other group of mothers in the county. And what I wanted to say was
as a mother who is being shamed by a local activist group who believes that something is violent
and dangerous as a gun could or should not deserve sanctuary. Arguing that sanctuary is defined
as a place of safety and refuge in no place for a gun. Well, I would like to say to them and to
you all that it is so much more than about guns themselves. It is about the individual rights
the Constitution protects that deserve the sanctuary. The Constitution has stood firm in governing
our country for over 200 years despite political parties members of Congress sitting and
campaigning presidents and activist groups trying to change it. The second amendment and the
people who are defending it absolutely deserve a sanctuary from the activist group who blame it
for society's problems today and the political parties that seek to gain power from destroying it.
As a mother of two small children I have the right to defend my household with whatever type
of weapon I choose. And I thank you all for letting me speak tonight.
Thank you.
Followed by Elise Trinch.
Good evening, Ian Antons, Back Creek District.
So tonight I would like to request a second resolution to be discussed and voted on during
the next Board of Supervisors meeting and with this momentum going hopefully we the people
of Frederick County could request the same. And that's a resolution of Frederick County having a
militia resolution. This resolution would follow the footsteps of Paswell County Virginia and
affirming per title 44 chapter one of the Code of Virginia that the militia of the Commonwealth
of Virginia should consist of all able body citizens of this Commonwealth who are at least 16 years
of age, not more than 55. The militia should be divided into four classes, the Virginia National Guard,
the Virginia State Defense Force, the Naval militia and lastly the unorganized militia.
So specifically this resolution will affirm the unorganized militia highlighted in title 44 chapter
one as the men and women of Frederick County. And in doing so in this resolution Frederick County
supports its militia in the falling four areas, law, education, public safety and training.
By recognizing the people of Frederick County as an unorganized militia it lawfully protects us
against any future infringements and is prepared to defend them by the county attorney's office.
It's a well-regulated militia composed of the body of the people. Secondly with the education
the board will then direct the public school board to offer Hunter's education classes to those
16 years of age or older as then their then legal age to be part of the unorganized militia.
It would direct the Frederick County Sheriff's Office to utilize the current existing
school resource officers to provide such after-school education on responsible firearm safety
and use as in the hunter safety curriculum. And then in relationship to public safety it would
direct the fire and rescue department to offer a single day course of tactical emergency
casualty care which the civilian equivalent of the T-Triple C course being a veteran myself I
had that training and it's by far the gold standard for emergency trauma care. And then we would
offer a public safety initiative to have a $200 tax credit for those who have attended this class
to go out and purchase their own individual first aid kit to carry out their home vehicle or
on person. So in doing so they may render care to the citizens of Frederick County as a good
Samaritan to our citizens until a higher level of care arise by training in peace and paramedics
such as myself. Lastly it would seek to allow the citizens of Frederick County to train with
their firearms by establishing Frederick County public a Frederick County public shooting range.
This range would be overseen by the Parks and Rec Department. This range would provide the
necessary location for safe handling and discharge of firearms of those who lack the acreage to do so
and trained knowledgeable staff to assist novice shooters that are maybe seeking their
concealed carry for the first time. This public shooting range would also bring in new jobs and
additional revenue to the county while keeping our citizens trained and safely armed.
Ladies and gentlemen of the board I just came up with this initiative while it's on the toilet to be honest
and these are to me better than some of the initiatives that came out of Richmond lately.
So I'm sorry three minutes wrap would you commend please wrap up yes sir. An initiative to
the clip I should be better as neighbors and citizens and not laws and infringement upon our
God-given rights. I ask all of you have to take the next steps to work with us on a
militia resolution the weeks ahead and the people of Frederick County I ask for your continued
pressure and support to make Frederick County recognize as the unorganized militia in the weeks
ahead to truly protect us with a legal precedent while truly making our county a safer place to live.
Thank you. The least print follows our Richard Good.
My name is Least Trinch I'm from the Back Creek District. I would like to second most of the
comments that have come before me so far today. I only desire to reiterate that I believe that
this issue is not only a matter of safety for myself and my family but also safety for this county
the Commonwealth of Virginia and the nation as a whole. So I just ask that you support the
Second Amendment Sanctuary County proposal because I would love to wake up tomorrow knowing that
all these people came out in support of this and that our county is now a sanctuary county. Thank you.
Richard Good followed by Sean Thompson.
Good evening. My name's Richard Good. I live in Stonewall District.
I've lived in four countries. I've lived in Virginia since 1984 all except for four years
in North Carolina. The first three countries I lived in I knew of two people that were shot at.
One was my grandfather by the Germans in World War I. The second one was my father who was shot
by the Japanese in World War II. Since I've lived in Virginia, I've personally been shot at twice
by a random guy with a gun in the subway in New York. My next door neighbor in Chesapeake,
their son was at Virginia Tech during the first shooting. My daughter was at Virginia Tech
during the second shooting. The police officer that was killed in the second shooting left five
children. My daughter's boyfriend went to Sandy Hook Elementary School.
When I lived in Chesapeake, I had a drainage lake behind us. I pulled an AK-47 wrapped in a sheet
out of the lake one day. Called Chesapeake Police. They came. They peaked it up. They said I could have
it back after 30 days. They would do ballistics tests on it. No background police checks. No
nothing. I would just call them up. The officer gave me his card, said he would bring it out to me.
Virginia Beach. I had a business in Virginia Beach. I'm retired. I moved up here. I used to go
in the permits office almost every day. Some of the people that were killed were personal friends
of mine. So there are other people here that obviously had family, friends, other people
killed or shot. Passing a resolution is great. Somebody obviously spent a lot of time writing it.
But obviously the system is not working. Somebody really needs to sit down and figure out some
legislative proposals that will work to stop at least some of these people getting guns
and doing what they do. Because it's not a matter of whether there will be another shooting.
It's just a matter of when. That's all I have to say.
Sean Thompson, followed by John Taylor.
Good evening board. Good evening everyone. My name is Sean Thompson. I'm from the OPEC
District. I'd like to thank the board tonight for putting the resolution addressing the second
member on the consent agenda for the evening's meeting. This means to me that our board agrees and
has a consensus regarding the rights of the people to keep in bear arms as is recognized by this
document, the United States Constitution. I would like to make my comment tonight about the idea
that adopting this resolution is meaningless, that it's merely symbolic. Symbolism is very powerful.
We started this meeting pledging our allegiance to a symbol, a flag, a piece of cloth on a stick to
some, but it is a symbol of freedom and liberty to myself and others. I hope everyone in the
stream tonight also believes the same. The symbol, the flag of the United States, is recognized
worldwide as the symbol of a political experiment that is almost 250 years old and that has led to
the most successful and powerful nation on the planet. There are men and women at this very moment,
some I know personally, that wear this symbol on their shoulders to stars leading the way
in some of the most dangerous places on earth fighting for the freedoms and liberties that this flag
represents. Right now, if you pay attention to the current events in the news, in Hong Kong,
this same symbol, the flag of the United States, is being flown by people hoping to attain their
freedoms, adopting it for what it represents. While this resolution may be symbolic, it does represent
the will of the people of this fine county. Thank you for your time.
Areal-Banagan. I'm sorry, John Taylor followed by Areal-Banagan.
I want to thank you for the opportunity to express my first amendment rights and to speak a little
bit on the second amendment rights. Your name and your name?
I'm sorry, John Taylor, cross-junctioned Virginia, I believe they're 85 plus years.
On the second amendment rights, most of us know and people that have spoken before me very
eloquently have brought out why we're here. The second amendment rights gives us the right to bear
and keep arms for one reason. And that is to see that a tyrannical government does not try to
take us over. So I'll cut right to the chase and simply take it pretty simple. We are standing as
I see it on the precipice of a civil war. Now, I hope you all are taking this seriously because
we're being pushed into a corner and we're here to defend the Constitution of the United States of
America. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Areal-Banagan followed by Dodie Stautelmar.
Areal-Banagan.
Good evening, board. My name is Areal-Banagan in the back creek district.
I want to thank you for your support for the second amendment this evening and ask for your
continued support in this fight that we face. I also invite all of you as well as the other
second amendment supporters gathered here tonight to keep this momentum going and join me in
Richmond on January 20th for Virginia Citizens Defense League's annual Lobby Day event.
I will close my remarks with the following quote for the proponents of civilian disarmament to think
about. If society is honest and historically accurate, the only question that has any relevance
to the gun control debate is do you trust those in government now and forever in the future to not
take your life, liberty or property through the force of government. If the answer to that question
is no, the gun control debate is over. Thank you.
Dodie Stautelmar followed by Kim Highland.
Good evening, my name is Dodie Stautelmar and I'm from the Shawnee District.
I want to thank all of you guys this evening on the board for entertaining this resolution and
putting it on the consent agenda. I like all of my fellow speakers. I'm an unashamed gun owner.
I support the second amendment. I support the first amendment. I support the right of the two
people who or three people who disagreed with this movement to get it up here and speak.
What I would like to talk about is how grateful I am for so many people who have paid a
attention and who have come out and I really hope that this is going to morph into a movement
for them not just for the second amendment rights but for all the other bills that are coming down
the pike from Richmond and there are plenty of them for them to pay attention and to get out
and to make their voices heard against all these other bills as well. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Jim Highland, followed by Danny Leaning.
Good evening, my name is Kim Highland. I'm a resident of the Gainesboro District of
Frederick County since 2012. I've also been a citizen of Virginia for 45 years and I've never
been prouder than I have been in the last few weeks. As the citizens of this common sense state
have sent a message to our lawmakers and the rest of the country that we will hold them to the
supreme law of the constitution of our country and of our state. Most relevant, I'm a mother of six
and a grandmother of seven, a family whose welfare are paramount to me. I hadn't planned to attend
tonight while the talk around our dinner table has consisted of little else than the subject
at hand this evening. I'd plan to stay home and let my husband and sons represent.
But two days ago I received a text from our oldest son. He's an instructor in the physical
education department at the U.S. Naval Academy. The text said a former student of his had been
shot five times and killed. A recent U.S. and a graduate Josh Watson was the victim of a violent
gun crime in a quote gun-free zone. He was shot and killed on Naval Air Station Pensacola,
a military compound where he and expert marksman and the former captain of the U.S. and a rifle
team had been stripped of his human and constitutionally protected right to defend himself.
Fox News reported that Watson's family said that their son was a marksman and they believe
the situation would have turned out differently. Had he been allowed to have a service weapon on
the base his brothers quoted a saying these men and women are asked to go defend their country
overseas or wherever and my brother was an expert marksman. He was captain of the rifle team for
the Navy. He was well qualified to have a firearm and defend himself. This is immoral
that it happens on a military base a place that exists to protect our country's citizens with
the necessary threat of lethal force is assinine. Our military bases like our homes should be the
safest and most well defended places in our country. There's been some talk of fear mongering
this evening and I would say that there's no need to monger fear unless you live in a hole
in our ignorant of the world events and history and the impact of gun control on them. You know
the reality of fear in our day and age violence is a sober reality of life so the need to responsibly
defend ourselves against those who had wished to harm us is fundamental and right and therefore
a fundamental right. I've never been more convicted of the need for all of us to claim and
defend our rights for the safety and welfare of our families communities and country.
My prayers are with Joss Watson and the other victims families as well as our country's
leaders and citizens. I may God comfort those who mourn and wake up the rest of us. Thank you.
Do you any landing followed by Iris Flores?
Good evening gentlemen. My name is Danny Lining, Opaquin District and
I'm so proud to see so many patriots that is coming out to express their views and their concern
over the dawn away with our Constitution. There's a lot of discussion about well the
Constitution's old and antiquated it is not worth anything but let's go back to one of our
founding fathers Thomas Jefferson when every question of construction let us carry ourselves
back to the time when the Constitution was adopted recollect a spirit manifested into debates
and instead of trying what meaning may be squeezed out of the text or invented against it
conformed to the probable one in which it was passed. Let's go back to the declaration of independence.
We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by
their creator with certain unalbile rights that among those of life liberty and the pursuit of
happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their
just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes
destructive for these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to
institute new government laying its foundation on the principles and organizing his power in such
form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness the actions that's
being taken it's rooted in the declaration of independence it's rooted in the Constitution
local utilities and states has the authority to not enforce unconstitutional laws provided by
the great white father quite federal government or our state government any unconstitutional laws
you have the right to say we are not going to adhere to them and it's so spelled out in the
Constitution there's a lot of things that has been said that was in my speech which I was afraid
that we're going to have enough time to do but first annual address by George Washington
among the many interested subjects which will engage your attention that are providing for the
common defense will merit particular regard to be prepared for war is one of the most
eventual means of preserving peace a free pop pre people are not only to be armed but disciplined
to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is records just a story where it's used in
McDonald versus Chicago 2010 the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms is likely seen
as the validity of the liberties of a republic the founders of this nation understood the source
of nailable rights never from the government sir we have a lot of people want to speak too if you
can include very quickly very quickly I pray to God that people that are here now these dedicated
patriots will continue with this movement to show the tyrannical government that we will not
stand and allow it to occur and thank you all very much thank you
followed by Tim Roberts good evening my name is Iris Flores and I live in the Gainesboro district
I appreciate the opportunity you have all given me to express my opinion as a citizen American
citizen born and raised in Puerto Rico I was astounded at the level of respect for the second
amendment that I discovered when I moved to the United States in the 80s the reason is because I
used to live in a country where you had to prove the need to own and carry a firearm like my father
had to and to prove that you were an outstanding citizen in order and that you post no threat
to the community in order to be allowed to own a gun let alone carry it all of those so-called
common sense measures that neither prevent any abuse nor keep firearms away from criminal
hands I also discovered that although different in practice in different states the right of the
citizen to wear to wear arms was pretty much accepted and respected by the government officials in
the mainland back then 30 some years later I am distorted fact that this God-given right is
under direct attack from those that are trying to undermine our laws and our country and in the
process made people like myself a felon for trying to teach my grandchildren or my girlfriends
how to properly safely use a firearm and I therefore encourage you members of the board to take
a stand with us the citizenship to stop this power grab from Richmond that either way will not
stop there they will continue to grab as long as we allow them and defend the only recourse that we
have against tyranny in our country thank you very much Robert followed by Julie Mitchell
good evening I'm Tim Roberts from the Back Creek District you can raise your microphone up here Mr.

I'd like to start by saying I'm a proud American citizen I'm a proud citizen of the state of
Virginia and I come to you with one request keep me proud this great country was started by people who
understood and valued the value of guns when seconds count help is only minutes away

Campbell Lukas Cook
okay
I want to thank you for allowing me to speak to see my name is John Campbell and the
Gainesboro District.
I have a lot here written down, but I'm not going to read from that.
It's sad that we're here to discuss this.
It's a pathetic thing that blood has been shed long before us to give us the rights that
we're here to talk about.
I'm amazed to see the people here together.
It should be like this all the time.
When our rights are infringed on, I would love to invite anybody to go where I go on a daily
basis in North East DC and see where your rights dot the bare arms and how much protection
you have.
There's police officers at McDonald's were in both of us from the day the time they open
to the time they close.
A bank won't catch a check for $300 because of the robberies.
I see that on a daily basis with MS-13 cars are broken into at 10 o'clock during the day
when the site's fully loaded with people and the only protection we have here as Virginia
is what is under attack.
My son right now goes to Jameswood High School.
My will get a message from my wife that ambulance is coming there to take him to taking to
the hospital, but I'm here for the rights that we shouldn't have to defend and shouldn't
be talked about about this board and our governors in Virginia.
I fear that this would be a better resolution to talk about it.
Police officers do a great job and I commend them 100 percent, but they're called when there's
a problem, they can try to stop it, but when somebody pulls a gun out at somebody and
you're calling for that help, you down your feet or you're on your knees and I choose
to dial my feet.
It's just sad that I have to be here and not with my family to look at the bigger picture
to protect my family when I should be with my son.
I just think the whole political thing is spiraled out of control and we as Project County
and in Virginia need to take a stand because the option of that, you all have read history
in school.
The only thing that reminds us of history is history repeating itself and you should
take that long and think hard about it because us, the people, elect you all to keep us
in good faith, but when good faith is not taking care of us, the people will stand on
foot our feet down and fight behind every blade of grass that's been talked about and
I don't think that we should be here after discussed that.
I appreciate your all's time and I appreciate the community for coming out.
I just think it should happen more often to stand up for what we believe in.
Thank you.
Thank you.
What is Lucas Cook?
Thank you all for giving me the opportunity to come here and talk to you.
I'm Lucas Cook from the Shawnee District and sorry I'm new to this.
These United States were founded on people that got up in the middle of the night grab
their gun and went outside and faced the British head on.
What happened is that what would have happened if they didn't have their guns?
My grandmother, you know, she had a gun, my grandfather had a gun, everybody I knew
had at least one gun or something in their house.
Keep us safe.
What if we don't have that?
What's going to happen?
You know, you have Chicago, they have gun laws that don't let you have guns, look at
the crime rates, look at the murder rates, Baltimore has the same thing, so does DC.
Let's just get smart people.
Thank you.
Dale Robinson, David Williamson, Glen Bergeron, Charles Uphouse.
Good evening, David Williamson, Gainesburg District and I'm the owner of Winchester Wireless
and I feel like Sam in swimming upstream tonight because I'm here for the other matter that
is on the agenda which is the ordinance that is before you for amendment regarding towers
in Frederick County.
I want to start by saying I support everybody in here and they're right to the second amendment
and I'm a concealed carry holder myself and so I do 100% support that.
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight and I'll try to keep my
comments brief.
I'm in support of what is before you right now in regards to this ordinance to be able
to allow commercial use towers.
Yes.
If you will, that comes up in a public hearing later.
This is for citizen comments that are not up here.
The tower there.
This is not says in comments.
This is citizen comments but it's not for items that are for public hearing.
That is up for public hearing and that would be the time you would make your comments
about that.
Okay.
I've wrote on there towers so she called me up here.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
So thank you.
Do I remember my comments for sometime other than tonight then?
No.
A little later in the agenda.
Okay.
All right.
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you.
Glenn Bergeron, Charles Uphouse, Josh Morgan, Brandon Angel,
I have been trying to get this same second amendment resolution for the city of Winchester
itself.
I'm glad so many people have shown up tonight to support Frederick County but we need
this support for Winchester as well.
It's been beautiful to see this here tonight as per last night's Winchester City Council
meeting.
We have two council members already on board.
Please if you live work or travel within the city, please write the Winchester City Council
as well.
I'm sure most are aware of Northam's grandfather clause.
Again this fight is not just for our rights but for future Virginians.
We must not let up on him and the legislator that wish to take away our rights.
I've been made aware that Northam has been calling independent cities saying he will
cut off funding to our police forces.
It is evident to me our governor does not care at all for our safety or our rights.
He cares only for the suburbs of DC, Richmond and his donors.
I will constantly and consistently say we say no to compromise, no to his grandfather
clause and no to Northam.
Northam's laws and red flag laws, Senate Bill 16, 18, 64 would make myself an Army infantry
veteran college graduate, VFW and Ann Vett's member of felon.
Many of the protesters against this movement point to Dylan's law, which I am aware of.
However, I ask Northam and those protesters how come it can be used when Northam wants
illegal immigrants, sanctuary cities, but not for a second amendment.
Northam and his supporters seem to me to be hypocrites and do not want the law to apply
to them as equally.
These gun laws are unjust and unconstitutional and they will not be followed.
This is now a national discussion for our rights and since Virginia is leading the way
against these laws, I will say rally around Virginia bullies, rally around Virginia, thank
you.
Hello, my name is Josh Morgan and I'm from the Redbud District.
I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak before you today.
I have to alter my speech a little bit because I didn't realize the consent agenda was
what it was.
But I would, it is my belief that the resolution before you today supporting the second amendment
is not necessary.
The resolution is no more than an affirmation of what the constitution already guarantees.
The right to bear arms has been upheld in many cases, including most famously in the DC
versus Heller ruling of 2008.
In this case, the Supreme Court made the important distinction that the right to bear arms was
not contingent on service in a militia.
This resolution also states that there may be legislation passed through Congress or
the Virginia General Assembly that would infringe our second amendment rights.
I do not believe this to be the case.
There has always been need for clarification on certain passages in the constitution as
is exemplified in the DC versus Heller case and if not all Supreme Court cases.
These clarifications are not used to strike down any constitutional rights but simply to update
them for the current day.
It is my opinion that this resolution might be used to deter needed gun reform to the
citizens of Frederick County under the guise of protecting our rights.
Secondly, rather Congress, nor the Virginia General Assembly aims to take away the rights
of any law abiding citizen, they simply aim to regulate.
This kind of regulation that was proposed by Governor Northam earlier this year, the
kind of regulation that was proposed earlier this year by Governor Northam include things
like number one, universal background checks in order for the safe sale of guns between
private citizens, number two, requiring anyone to report a lost or stolen firearm to the
police within 24 hours, and number three, creating a red flag law that would allow courts
to seize guns from people who a judge would deem a threat to themselves and others.
Red flag laws themselves have an off-look benefit.
According to a June 2018 study conducted in Connecticut and Indiana, red flag laws
brought about a 13.7% reduction in firearm suicides.
In Indiana, a 7.5% reduction in firearm suicides in the 10 years following its adoption.
According to another June 2018 study conducted by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
Health, quote, requiring handgun purchasers to obtain a license prior to a purchase was
associated with an 11% reduction in firearm homicide.
Currently, end quote, currently Virginia does not require a permit to open carry a handgun
for those 18 and older.
In conclusion, it is my belief that you should not pass this resolution.
Not because I don't care about the constitution or the rights given to me, I simply believe
that it is a necessary step to take.
When hinder any further efforts by the Virginia General Assembly or Congress to heal our country
and community, thank you for your time.
Sean Miller, followed by Samantha Smith, Sean Miller, Samantha Smith, Harry Miller,
Richard Van Norton, Mr. Chairman and supervisors, fellow veterans and citizens of Frederick County.
My name is Richard Van Norton.
I was born and raised in the Commonwealth and I consider myself a proud Virginia.
I shot my first rifle when I was eight years old.
Mr. Norseman, could have your Magisterial District please.
I beg your Magisterial District.
I'm sorry.
Back Creek District.
Thank you.
You used to represent me, Gary.
Sir.
I shot my first rifle when I was eight years old.
A 22 caliber rifle on a Cub Scout with a Cub Scout pack on a farmer's makeshift range.
I received a comprehensive and detailed class on gun safety before I ever touched that rifle.
I got my own rifle at 12 years old.
I shot with a Boy Scouts until I went to the Marine Corps in 1968.
I went to the Marine Corps to avoid the draft.
I retired here and was employed by the Boy Scouts and supervised the rifle range at Camp Rocking
and on its four weekends.
My knowledge, to my knowledge, no Boy Scouts ever been shot on a BSA range since shouting
program began in 1910.
I'm an infantry Marine with two tours in Vietnam and I retired as a Sergeant Major in the Marine
Corps.
What the, what the Governor of Virginia proposes will make me a felon.
I've never committed an offense more serious than a speeding violation.
My friends tend to be law enforcement officers and fellow veterans and other citizens that
are law-biting citizens.
Do not, I beg you, endorse or support this latest proposal by our Governor.
Veterans by and large own firearms were law-biting citizens that have served our country honorably.
Assault rifles are defined as anything that looks like a combat rifle.
A squirt gun got an elementary school student removed in Shenandoah County some years ago.
Under the zero tolerance heading, how about zero common sense?
Please declare Frederick County a sanctuary county in regard to the Second Amendment.
Certainly before the General Assembly, do not allow the Governor to make gun laws that
will not stop tragedy, but will create a whole new class of felons, our Virginia veterans.
Thank you for your time.
My name is Samantha Smith, I'm from the Opec in District, I don't have a speech, I'm just
a normal citizen, I run a business here in Frederick County and I have my concealed weapons
permit, I have for years, I don't go anywhere without it in this county.
It's one of the things that makes me as a woman, running a business, able to do my job without
having the fear of somebody coming in and harming me.
I've never had a speeding ticket, I've never had parking ticket, I don't want to become
a convicted felon, but I think if you look around the room in here there are a lot of
people that feel very strongly, and I don't believe that they will comply, I'll be one
of them.
Thank you.
My name is Harry Miller from the Auburn District and I'm not going to repeat, a lot of people
said a lot of things that I wanted to say earlier today already, the only thing I want
to question is, and I hope everybody questions this because I read news and listen to news
about it and it seems like it's always avoided, avoided.
Are the people we really voted for down Richmond, I don't think so, and I think the number of
people that come out show that, compared to the number of votes that they say are registered,
and I'd like to have that checked, that's all I have to add, thank you, thank you.
Mr. Naylor, Steve Fertig, Lloyd Suggler, Lincoln Kiefer, Stacey Spadafore, good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
My name is Stacey Spadafore, I'm from the Red Broad District.
It's Contankery, pulling it up there and it'll stay after a while, thank you.
Thank you so much for allowing me to come and exercise my first amendment rights this
evening, which is guaranteed by the Second Amendment, which I think the majority of folks
here realize because we studied civics and history.
I would like to remind everyone that the Bill of Rights outlines our rights against government
years of patient.
So it's not like any government can come in and legally change any of those amendments
because they were guaranteeing our citizens' rights.
And the reason, of course, we all know that the second is the second right behind the
first is because without the second, we lose the first.
I'm a veteran of 26 years from the Army Reserves, spent three years in Iraq and Afghanistan,
and I've been all over the world in a number of countries where they do not have the
first amendment to guarantee freedom of speech.
It's not something to toy with or to take lightly.
And because the Second Amendment gives us a God-given right to defend ourselves both
on an individual basis and against tyranny, it's crucial to keep that foundation for all
the Bill of Rights.
Thank you so much for again allowing me to express my first amendment rights.
And thank you for voting to guarantee our rights here and send a message to Richmond.
Thank you.
I'm going to say that I'm not going to comply and if it makes me a fel in so be it, I really
appreciate what law enforcement has done for us and still continues to do.
And Sheriff Milholland, we look to you to be our first defense against these tyrannical
laws.
Thank you.
Good evening, my name is Steve Furtig and Redbud District.
I come here tonight and I want to say that I'm very concerned about what's going on.
I have two sons serving the military, one in the military, one in the SWAT team captain
in Chesterfield County, one is Army Ranger and four Collins.
And if they were here tonight, they would probably say the same thing I, a day don't support
these draconian laws that are proposed by our governor in this state.
I'll put it simply and then I'll leave number one is God in my life.
Number two is my wife, number three is my family, number four is my guns, number five second
amendment along with the rest of the constitution.
And we would never have a constitution if we didn't have that second amendment or before
the guns to defend that.
We had to fight for that and if we give them up now, we're going to be at the same place
we were back in 1776, we'll be fighting for our freedoms.
We'll lose them.
We need those guns to protect ourselves and anybody thinks otherwise is living in a dream
where it's not going to happen.
We need those guns to protect ourselves, it's just as simple.
We don't want to think that in today's society, but we see it.
We see what's happening.
We see what's happening against our president for three years, a kangaroo court, politicians
who you would hope and think that are representing you, but they're not.
They find him guilty first and then you got to defend yourself to be innocent.
Something's wrong with that.
So I won't give up my weapons, they'll have to take them from me.
My dead cold hands, the day they try.
My guns have never shot anyone, I'm a peaceful, law-abide citizen.
I own two businesses here in the county and my SWAT team captain told me the day they
stack up on the porches to take law-abide citizens' weapons away as the day he steps down.
And my army rangers, I said the same thing.
I have lots of law-abiding citizens, I have a lot of federal agents, a lot of sheriffs,
deputies in three counties, and they all tell me the same thing.
They're not going to enforce these laws.
I guess they'll find somebody who will, but it's none that I know.
Thank you for your time, have a good evening.
My name is Jill Shields.
My last one.
My name is Jill Shields.
I'm from the Kurds town district, the Opaquan area, as I heard it called earlier.
When you're out here acting though, there's a fight for equality, a war on women.
I cannot think of a more effective equalizer than a gun, as Sylvia said earlier.
Every woman married single gay, straight black, white, Hispanic, single moms, especially
should be outraged.
Completely outraged the idea the government is trying to take away your God-given right
as an American law-abiding citizen to protect your family, your children, your home, your
belongings, and your person.
It should be expressed to the idea they want to take your safety away by forcing gun
free zones, these where 100% of mass shootings occur.
Experiments are underway now in Chicago.
I do not wish to make my hometown and lifelong town and state a war zone.
Criminals think twice knowing the chance the public might be armed.
And crime is further lessened when the public is armed.
Gun owners are less likely to commit crimes because of the fear of losing their rights.
I'm not a gun fanatic, I'm not a hunter, and I'm not going to state whether or not I carry,
but I do dread being in a situation where I wish I did.
Almost everyone I know is a gun owner and really great people and contributing members
of society.
I bet I can't say that for the gun grabbers.
The control extremists not only do not know gun owners, but they know nothing about the
weapons they wish to regulate.
I'm very close to someone whose mother was murdered with a gun.
Very close.
I have a relative who was shot in the face accidentally and came out unscathed.
Neither of these people are anti-gun.
These incidents tell me nothing about guns and a lot about people.
And these two victims I speak of, as I said, are quite the opposite of anti-gun.
I can state all these very obvious pro-gun facts all night long or cite the collectors and
those who inherited from their families.
But these are not the true reasons why I'm here and want to speak on this.
But the government, the government that we, the people, are meant to rule, not the other
way around.
Gun control means people control.
In four days it will be 228 years since this ratification to the Constitution was signed.
People try to interpret what shall not be infringed means, but spare me your slippery
slope.
The speeches and writings of the forefathers make it clear.
They were breaking away from a tyrannical government.
I would also like to emphasize and I am skipping a bit.
But I read your, what you're signing tonight, your consent.
And I didn't see a lot or anything in there about the Fourth Amendment, which is even
a little more terrifying and how they would take our guns by just coming into our homes.
Just being a free people, free to arm ourselves as we please in a lawful manner guarantees
our protection from the government.
The Constitution sets America and not to mention Virginian's own Constitution.
These documents set us apart from most of the world.
It is so arrogant for many on the left to believe that they know better.
The most delightful thing is for anyone who wants to be ruled and they can go anywhere
they like.
If I could get you to conclude very quickly, we have others who want to make.
I will.
The Sarming People is the most effective way to enslave them.
That was George Mason.
I would like to thank everyone for letting me speak tonight and for my First Amendment
rights, which I still have for now.
Thank you.
Mark Stickley.
Mark Stickley.
My name is Mark Stickley.
I live in the city of Winchester.
I own two rental properties in Steven City.
If Winchester starts collecting guns, I may move into one of those.
We're one in Shenandoah County.
I'm here to argue in favor of making Frederick County a second Amendment sanctuary city.
We know that the Democratic control of the State House will impose draconian laws in
January.
Of course, these gun control laws are more about control than the guns.
Red flag laws are simply guilty until proven innocent laws.
The one gun per month law had no effect the last time it was tried in Virginia.
The man of AR style guns, first of all, we haven't defined what an AR assault rifle is.
That can be also one of those slippery slopes.
Band of high capacity magazines just leaves a shorthanded.
The gun show loophole, I think a lot of people don't understand that they do background
checks at gun shows.
And of course, the universal background check is simply or well-earned for gun registration,
which everywhere it's been used, it leads to gun compensation.
I'm a law binding citizen and I own guns.
I have taught my children gun safety and how to shoot.
I convinced my wife to take a shooting class and get her concealed carry.
I couldn't teach her.
But my daughter can throw a means key and I love to shoot trap shooting and just target
practice.
Taking guns from criminals is certainly common sense, but making criminals of good people
who own guns is not.
Don't let us drift further from our Judeo-Christian values.
Allow me to quote the gospel of Luke, chapter 22, verse 36 precisely.
Jesus said, let him who has no sword sell his rope and buy one.
The second amendment is not about deer hunting.
It's about protecting ourselves from criminals and a tyrannical government.
Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight.
I have three more names that I haven't called yet.
Tim Skoe, Mary Bromley, Mike Grimm, and I'll go back to the ones we didn't hear from
Julie Mitchell, Kevin Rhodes, Brian Russell, Michael Osu, Walker, Glen Bergeron, Charles
Uphouse, Christian Nailer, Tim Stowe, Henry Bromley, and Mike Grimm for the second time.
Henry Bromley from Redbud District, I'll make a quick, served eight years in nuclear
navy.
They wouldn't let us carry a firearm, much to my chagrin, until the coal happened, and
then a lot of things changed, and then when I went back to my alma mater on USS Florida,
all of a sudden, people were carrying firearms.
There's a good reason, right, so, but then we kind of went back and forth, but I wouldn't
go back to Virginia since 2005, I moved to Virginia because I didn't want to move in
Maryland.
There's a reason I wanted to move here, but I didn't own a gun, I wasn't against other
people owning guns, but I didn't own a gun because at the time I didn't need one, until
we started having a lot of things happening in our county.
That hasn't happened before, we're seeing a lot of drugs, we're seeing a lot of stuff
happening in school playgrounds, and my wife didn't feel safe for kids, and it was time
that we decided we were going to finish ourselves.
We got what everybody could start off with, which is now an assault weapon, I mean, it's
ridiculous.
I guess we can go back to revolvers, but I've already said, if push comes a shot,
you know, unfortunately, I have a federal job, I have a very high clearance, I'll do
it with the law, I'll be happy about it, I'll go pro the hell out of it, and I'll make
sure I get a lawyer after I turn over everything, I need to turn over, or if I can move out of
the state, I will, I don't want to, I love it here, Northam and they're going to start
a civil war, they just are, it's coming, but, you know, I mean, we either stay up now
or we secede, I mean, I don't see any other choice, right, but, you know, hopefully,
they'll listen, you know, what, are we 78, and after tonight, hopefully it's over 80,
and, you know, we can stay the state of Virginia, or the Commonwealth of Virginia, and, you
know, not the state of San Andoa, I guess it's anything's possible, but I'd like to stay,
you know, Virginia and free, so, God bless everybody, and thanks for, you know, listening,
speak, so.
Thank you.
I can call the names that we haven't heard from one more time, Julie Mitchell, Kevin
Rhodes, Brian Russell, Michael Osu, Robert Walker, Glenn Bergeron, Charles Uphouse, Sean
Miller, Christian Nailer, Lincoln Kiefer, Tim Stowe, and Mike Grimm.
All right.
Thank you, Ms. Phillips, seeing none, we will close these citizen comment period, and thank
everyone for coming out.
Those of you who didn't speak, thank you for your patience, and listening to everyone.
Those of you who didn't speak, thank you for your words of passion about the item that
which you came to address.
We will now take up the consent agenda, and, as I said earlier, on the consent agenda,
is the resolution addressing the second amendment.
Members of the Board, how would you like to take care of the consent of agenda?
This is Mrs. Rhodes.
Do you hear me?
Any agenda?
Justice Second.
Is there a second?
A second.
All right.
All right.
This precar is a roll call vote, any discussion?
Mr. Dunne?
Mr. Welles?
Aye.
That's out.
Supervisor Slater.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Aye.
Chairman and vote, the consent agenda is approved.
Thank you again, everyone.
Mr. Chairman, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
A lot's been said this evening about the importance of the Second Amendment.
A lot's been said tonight about the Second Amendment.
And I can't express how much I appreciate that I live in a country where the very found from its very foundation.
It was recognized that certain rights and liberties must be guaranteed to the individual citizens.
And I have to say listening to so many people from Gainesboro come out tonight.
I feel just as blessed to live in Gainesboro district where people understand the truth of what are ten amendments the Bill of Rights protect.
I appreciate so much having neighbors like you who are willing to come out and stand up and speak for our rights.
The whole purpose of the U.S. Constitution is to grant to the government power necessary to do things that government must do.
But the Bill of Rights ensured that the government would still have to rely on us for its authority.
The government relies on us.
We, the people, the individuals whose rights are to be protected by the government.
And there are two ways that our Constitution made it so that the government would protect and rely on the individual.
One was to make the government accountable to us via elections.
We can vote them out.
If they attempt to infringe on our rights, we should vote them out.
And two, most decisions were intended to be left to us, the people of the several states.
And one of the things left to us is to a great extent our personal defense.
Our defense of our persons, our property, and our God given an alienable rights.
A few have criticized this resolution stating that it is a violation of law or at least improper for supervisors to pass this resolution.
There is nothing illegal or improper in stating on the record that we support the Constitution and our Constitutionally protected rights.
There is nothing illegal or improper in stating that we would not participate in any activity which would infringe upon an individual's constitutionally protected rights.
In fact, it's our sacred duty bound by an oath that each of us took when we became supervisors to represent the citizens of this county.
Others have criticized the mounting grassroots defense of the Second Amendment and have said that it is meaningless.
It's meaningless for the Board of Supervisors to pass this resolution.
This resolution is not meaningless. The resolution reaffirms that the elected officials of this board take very seriously our oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Commonwealth of Virginia.
All too often nowadays, politicians take that oath but they are only paying lip service.
Case in point, the legislators and Richmond who would consider passing laws or bridging our Second Amendment rights.
This resolution confirms for the people of Frederick County that the elected members of this board mean what we say when it comes to defending our Constitution.
This resolution is not meaningless because the resolution reflects what our constituents have been conveying to us, their representatives, namely that the people of Frederick County do not support any law that would infringe on our Constitution.
This resolution reflects what our citizens have been conveying to us, their representatives, namely that the people of Frederick County do not support any law that would infringe on our Constitution.
Again, I feel blessed to represent all of your good people. Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Mr. President McCarthy, Mr. President, Mr. Chairman.
As you follow out, would you please do it quietly? We will allow you time.
We will recess for five minutes to allow those who wish to leave.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, Mr. President.
The resolution we had on the Second Amendment is to protect our right to defend ourselves.
If you were an 86-year-old woman or a 13-year-old child and you're having a deal with multiple people coming into your home, having the ability to equalize that situation is critical.
When I was a boy, my parents refused to allow us to have guns. We had no toy guns, no cap guns, no nothing.
But we were trained to use real weapons, and we were told that these real weapons could kill, but they were designed for self-protection.
In 1967, those real weapons came into play, and we had race riots in our town, which our neighbor was killed, and we had multiple people coming who had military weapons that they had gotten from a local armory, stolen them, had pinned down the fire department, and for a period of 12 to 18 hours completely ruled the town.
Having a weapon to defend yourself under those circumstances is critical. There were no police.
It was tanks that armed personnel carriers that came in and made the difference.
In Frederick County, the sheriff has said to people, in some parts of this county, it will take us 20 minutes to get there.
That is too long when you have a critical situation.
The second amendment simply gives us the right to defend ourselves. Some of the laws coming out of Richmond, proposed coming out of Richmond, has said that even if you trained somebody that could make you a felon, I think that's wrong.
I think that well-trained people who know how to use weapons safely is an asset, not a detriment.
So, Mr. Chairman, I'm glad that we have supported this. For those that disagree with this, let's find a way to go and work together.
Unfortunately, there are already laws in the books to say it is illegal to rob, and it is illegal to kill.
Criminal forgets those laws. I do not see how disarming a population will help with that.
The woman in Virginia Beach, who was obeying the law, obeying her rules, by not taking the weapon into her workplace because her workplace said, please do not, in a cost of her life is wrong.
That woman, Mrs. Nixon, paid for her life by obeying rules that, in my opinion, were inappropriate.
So, if that we pass this, let's continue to work to try to go and provide laws that work for all.
We're not penalized those to go and simply need a weapon for self-protection.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You're welcome.
You got to come in.
It's very none. Move on to our agenda.
Next item, item IA was removed from the agenda.
We've got a B committee appointments. Our first appointment was the Board of Building Appeals.
We had before the application of Lloyd Winters, how would the board like to address that?
Mr. Chairman, I would move that we vote in favor of Mr. Winters from this seat.
Second.
I have a motion on the second discussion.
All those in favor, second by abusing.
Aye.
Those opposed?
Thank you, Mr. Lloyd Winters, as appointed to the Board of Building Appeals.
Shoney Land, sanitary justory advisory committee.
Although that's back creek, I'll ask Mr. Supervisor Dunn if he would take that item.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to recommend to reappoint.
Hugh Van Meter, to the position which expired on 11-9-19.
Okay, so you're second.
Second.
Okay, discussion.
All those in favor of reappointing.
Mr. Hugh B. Van Meter, to the Shoney Land, sanitary justory advisory committee.
Second by abusing.

Public hearings.
This is a public hearing for a 12 month outdoor festival permit request of Belgrove
plantation.
Mr. Chairman, very briefly, this is a 12 month festival permit.
What that does is allows Belgrove to hold events as they see fit throughout the year rather
than coming in for each event for a period of 12 months, as I think all the boardrooms
are aware.
There's been a number of events held at Belgrove without incidents, so I know there are executive
directors here.
If there's questions, let's thank us, the nature, the request.
Would you like to speak to the permit?
Hi, I'm Kristen Laiys, I'm in the back creek district, I'm the executive director of
Belgrove plantation.
Thank you for considering this permit this year.
We have had many successful events and no incidents, I'd be happy to answer any questions
or comments that come up in the public hearing.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Any questions, Mr. Laiys?
Thank you, Mr. Laiys.
Okay, this is an application for a 12 month outdoor festival permit request of Belgrove
plantation for all events to be held on the grounds of the Belgrove plantation, 336
Belgrove Road, Middletown, Virginia, the property owned by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation.
Is there anyone here who would like to speak for or against this permit request?
Please come forward, state your name, Magistral Death Creek, and limit your comments to three
minutes please.
Seeing none, we will close the public hearing, this is back creek, Mr. Brasard Dunn, mine
into that.
Mr. Chairman, I would move that the 12 month outdoor festival permit request of Belgrove
be approved.
Is there a second?
Second.
Discussion.
All those in favor approve of the 12 month outdoor festival permit request of a well-grilled
plantation, signify by saying aye.
Aye.
Thank you very much.
It is approved.
The next public hearing is an ordinance amendment to the Frederick County Code chapter 165
zoning article one, more specifically revisions to the Frederick County is an ordinance
to section 165-204.19 to permit commercial telecommunications, small cell facilities,
by right in certain zoning districts and codified changes from the Code of Virginia governing
local regulation of such facilities, Mr. Clan, I believe that yours.
Yes.
Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.
The purpose of this proposed amendment to chapter 165 of the zoning ordinance is to enable
smaller commercial telecommunication facilities in certain zoning districts by right and to
codify changes to the state code, creating a two track process for the approval of telecommunication
facilities and to enable communication facilities as defined by right in our office and manufacturing
or OM district in our higher education or H.E. zoning district.
The proposed changes to the telecommunications facilities section of the code or wholesale
in response to changes from the Code of Virginia and include new definitions and revisions to
the additional regulations for specific uses outlined in section 204-19.
Again, as a refresher for everyone, the current approval process is for all telecommunication
facilities regardless of their height, currently require the approval of a conditional use permit.
The proposed changes create a new two track process.
The first is administrative review eligible projects.
These are small cell facilities, structures 50 feet or less in height or co-location on existing tall structures.
Administrative review eligible projects would be permitted in all zoning districts and they would be reviewed
administratively by staff.
It also enables our standard process projects.
Again, this is the same as our current process and this would be for telecommunication monopoles and
towers over 50 feet in height.
They would require a conditional use permit, which requires public hearings before the planning commission and
the Board of Supervisors in addition to public notifications.
Again, the administrative review eligible projects tracked is intended to allow smaller telecommunication facilities,
such as structures 50 feet or less in height by right in order to enable better broadband service to
underserved areas of the county.
This item was proposed by the county attorney and by staff and it was discussed by the development review and regulations committee
that there's September 25th regular meeting and the committee supported the proposed changes.
The planning commission discussed this item on October 2nd and the Board of Supervisors discussed this item on October 9th.
The planning commission held a public hearing on November 6th and the item was forwarded to the Board of Supervisors with a recommendation of approval.
Following a public hearing this evening, staff is seeking action by the Board of Supervisors on this proposed ordinance amendment.
I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Carthy.
Are there any questions?
Mr. Carthy.
Thank you, Mr. Carthy.
Thank you, Mr. Client.
That's some purposes.
The ordinance this before tonight doesn't really change the law.
That's applicable in front of the county.
Is that correct?
We're really just updating our code to comply with what the state's already told us we have to do anyway.
Yes, sir.
That is correct.
Thank you.
Mr. Client, to reiterate what Mr. Carthy said, all this is doing is allowing 50 feet or less by right to comply with the code, correct?
Yes, sir.
That is correct.
Some additional questions.
If a person had a private ham radio tower, for example, and public facilities were put on it, would that private right be changed or in any way?
Private antenna are not part of the commercial telecommunications facilities regulations.
If someone has a private facility on their property and someone wanted to co-locate on it like a wireless service provider, they could do that under the administrative review eligible projects tracked of the new ordinance.
Okay. And last question is, this 50 foot is any place where you can have a by right.
So whether it's an RP or a, it's still applicable. Is that correct?
That is correct.
Yes, sir.
Any other questions, Mr. Client?
Thank you, Mr. Client.
This is a public hearing on the ordinance amendment to the Frederick County Code, chapter 165, zoning article 1, general provisions, specifically revisions to the Frederick County zoning ordinance to section 165-204.19
To permit commercial telecommunication, mall cell facilities, by right, in certain zoning districts, and codify changes from the code of Virginia governing local regulation of such facilities.
If anyone would like to speak, they were of or opposed to the proposed ordinance amendment, please come forward, state your magistrate district.
Your name and the magistrate district can limit your comments three minutes, please. Thank you.
Mr. Williams, and you're at the right time now.
Thanks, Roy.
I need to reintroduce myself, I suppose.
Thank you, and I'll try to be brief, although that's difficult.
First, I want to recognize what Supervisor McCarthy just said, which is this is basically just to affirm that Frederick County is going to follow the already passed state code,
which was back in 2017. So there really is no changes that are being made that would affect anything that we can do that Richmond has already said that we can do.
It's just basically recognizing that Richmond has already said it.
One of the things that Supervisor Dunne you just brought up, which I would like to bring up tonight, is the idea of a personal tower that could then be used for commercial use by permission of the owner of the tower.
So this, in my opinion, needs to be addressed, and it may need to happen after you guys were to vote on this as it is.
But I would really strongly recommend that that needs to be part of this.
In Clark County, they have already passed an ordinance of February of this year that addressed that very issue that allowed for personal broadband and personal use towers to be able to be erected in all but one historic overlay district of Clark County,
and in Clark County, we still have mature tree lines, even though we don't have the rolling terrain like we do as much over here in Frederick County.
50 feet is not enough in the majority of this county. I'm not going to throw any of my customers under the bus, but I've had a number of customers that have contracted us over the years to build their own personal broadband towers in excess of 50 feet in height.
And based on some rulings that were made by the zoning administrator a year and a half ago in April 2018 before the BGA, which were later upheld by the Circuit Court, unless you're in an RA district, you can't have a tower.
So if you're in R5 in the back creek district and you have a 20 foot television and tower, we, a television antenna tower, it's already been previously ruled and then upheld in Circuit Court here in Frederick County that you can't have it.
There's no problem because we have a lot of areas in this county that people don't have any other options for broadband service other than in some cases building their own tower.
I've had customers that have spent three, four, five thousand dollars with us to have an 80 to 120 foot tower erected in a lot of areas of this county just for them to be able to get broadband.
There are federal workers that telecommute, you know, kids that do work from home with the schoolwork, with the Chromebooks now.
So I would implore you that, yes, great, we can rubber stamp that we approve what Richmond's already said that we have to do anyway, but it doesn't go far enough.
And I don't think that addressing just commercial use towers goes far enough.
It's a certified letter here dated December 4th by the zoning administrator that they just sent to someone we built a tower for in 2010, a 100 foot tower in R.A. District, that they're citing here that is commercial use tower and has to come down.
I'll be 30 seconds.
Yes, sir.
So this property owner contracted us to build this tower as a physician in Steven City, 90 foot height that he needed just to get over his tree line to get service.
And he later allowed us the partner with him to put communication facility on there to service that entire subdivision.
And now almost 10 years later, the zoning administration wants to cite him and tell him he has to take the tower down or, and I quote, fair to comply with Frederick County zoning ordinance will result in a criminal complaint being filed against you.
This is what we're dealing with right now in Frederick County.
And I ask you to please help the citizens of Frederick County get better broadband by allowing us to do what we do and address personal use. Please as part of this.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
It's Molly Brandon.
I'm from the Stonewall District, but we just bought property in the back creek district.
It will be moving in September.
Thank you.
We have huge trees.
And my husband runs an internet business from our home.
So internet is critical.
My daughter already lives out there.
She can't get cell phone service.
So without when Chester wireless, she can even call 911 from her house.
So I agree with when Chester wireless, we've rich men this past this rule for 50 foot towers.
Well, that's fine in the neighborhoods where they came in and cleared all the trees.
But when you're out in the county and there's big trees, you need to be able to clear them so that we can get an internet also.
And I don't understand why it's restricted to 50 feet.
I mean, I just had to pay to move power lines so I could build my home and the telephone pole.
There are over 50 feet.
There's no lights on them.
No, they're there.
The trees are there.
I think 50 feet is just too low.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Good evening, survivors.
My name is John Jewel.
I'm in the back creek district.
I live on middle road.
I'm three-and-a-half miles from the city limits.
I do not have internet.
My internet is a MyFi.
What you need to look at is the overall master plan.
What are you doing?
What are we doing to do a better job?
A little bit background.
I just retired.
I'm the former CIA of the United States Senate.
And I spent many years for continuity programs.
We have got to look to a better job planning and working with the providers.
One of the concerns I think you're going to have is, right now it's 4G.
It's going to go 5G.
When it goes 5G, that means there are any more towers.
Do you want a tower put in your backyard?
There's already been a tower that was put into a neighborhood over in the back creek district
that did not have any permits.
That's over 100 feet.
That needs to be taken down.
I am not against small businesses, but I think we need to be doing a better job of working
with all the wireless providers and coming up with a comprehensive plan for what we're going to do
to find internet service out here in the county.
It's just the fact of life.
We need to be doing a better job of working together.
And I think that allowing a rule that someone can take a ham radio tour and turning into a commercial product
is absolutely wrong.
That product is put in there as a ham radio.
It's not put in there as a cellular tower for a company to make money off of.
Thank you.
Thank you.
David, I would also like to speak for against the proposed amendment.
I guess I'm a little perplexed.
He knows the law is 50 feet.
But why do they have to think to put 100 foot tower and a house across my house?
He knows it's 50 feet.
It's illegal, right?
So what kind of guy do we have instead of giving him?
He should be in jail.
He's a crook.
It's absolutely ridiculous.
I've talked to bankers and you know that I'm in the building industry.
How many builders I've talked to?
You're still in the builders to death.
They'll go in and throw the house, a spec house.
My God, somebody puts a tower next to you.
You're going to lose your ass with the house.
If you can even sell it, you might be upside down on your loan.
You won't take a spec house.
You know why?
It's got to be appraised at the end.
And if the bank comes in and appraises for $50,000 or less,
you've got to sell that house for that $50,000 to eat the house.
I've talked to bankers, Mark Demaris.
Mark Demaris, they're scared about it.
I've talked to real estate people.
They're scared.
Because when you approve this, there's a lot of places that are going to be very unsafe.
And if you want to pay me the $50,000 that he's going to take away from me on my house.
If you want to do that, I'm not going to say here and fight this.
But please, if you approve this, you're not only approving it for him.
You're approving it for anybody out there from the city,
from other states to come in and do the same thing.
So you may just have one tower.
You may have five towers in your neighborhood.
Good luck.
You're going to completely ruin the whole landscape of this beautiful county.
You're not going to be looking at the beautiful valleys and the mountains.
You're going to be looking at 100.
He was talking about 150 foot tower.
It's going to be an absurd thing.
And I hope to God.
You look out for your citizens of this county.
Because I even know zoning doesn't like it.
But besides, I appreciate your time.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Anyone else who would like to speak for our guests?
Good evening again.
Steve Brandon, my wife corrected me.
I'm in Stonewall district.
Thank you for that.
I just want to say that you understand you're passing something that the state has already essentially mandated.
And I've heard the word commercial a couple of times.
And I understand some people from what we just heard are concerned about.
People coming out and willy-nilly putting poles up.
I don't know any business.
It's going to do that unless they have a reason to put a pole somewhere.
But when we move into the back creek district, we're in an area where line of sight is great.
That's why we're going to move out there.
We've got beautiful trees around us.
We've got beautiful hills around us.
We do not have good cell phone service or internet options other than wireless.
So the only thing I would encourage you to do is to consider citizens such as myself,
our daughter and our neighbors, who need to have some kind of tower somewhere near us so that we can be connected to the internet.
For me, as my wife said, it's so that I can run my business.
But there are many families in that area whose children need to do homework and do studies.
And schools are demanding that they do those things wirelessly or through the internet now.
So I would just ask you to consider that as you pass this motion.
Thank you.
Okay.
Anyone else who would like to speak for our guns to propose amendment?
Seeing none, we'll close the public hearing.
Board, how would you like to supervise my Carthage?
I would move for the approval of the proposed ordinance.
Second.
Second.
Second.
Discussion?
Yes.
So perhaps I'm correct.
While I'm making the motion to approve this, I do recognize that there's an issue in the western part of the county.
You know, I don't think one size fits all.
Always works in Frederick County.
I think this is one of those situations where one size is going to fit all.
What works in, back wreaking Gainesboro isn't going to work necessarily in the districts on the east side of 81 or south of town.
What works on the east side of town and south doesn't work for us out in Gainesboro.
There's kids that don't have internet access.
So immediately following this, I plan to make another motion if I may.
In order to ask for further work to be done on this to be forwarded back to the board of supervisors through the normal channel in order to address some of those issues.
Good.
Thank you.
Other discussion?
Supervisor Dunn.
I'd like to hear whether staff has some additional comments to make in light of the public comments that were made.
And I have a question for Mr. Klein.
Mr. Klein.
Yes, sir. Mr. Dunn.
So first of all, Mr. Klein, you've heard some comments.
Can you address the comment that was made on Ham Radio's versus commercial?
That's one.
Second, can you address the issue where, for example, I'm in red butter, which is a commercial, which is a residential area.
And under this situation, anybody can put up a 50-foot pole.
Is that correct?
That is correct.
So start with your second question first.
The by-right tower height is up to 50 feet.
That is irregardless of the district or location in the county.
It's 50 feet.
Anything above 50 feet, such as a commercial monopole of 100 feet, 125 feet, 199 feet.
That would go through the conditional use permit process, which is our current process for any telecommunication facility.
So there is an opportunity to extend that height beyond 50 feet.
It just requires a conditional use permit, which in turn requires a public hearing and public notices.
Before we go on to the point number two, to gentlemen that made the comment about degradation of his house,
do you have any other information on that pro or con on that issue, meaning that I live in a house, my neighbor has a house, my neighbor has a house.
If each of us put up a tower, then he's both a fourth house.
An issue or not an issue to the best of your knowledge?
I don't necessarily know if I can speak to property values as it relates to the establishment of telecommunication in the vicinity.
I don't think I have any answer to that question.
Going back to your first question, private antenna for ham radio or satellite dishes for cable television are not part of the telecommunication facilities ordinance.
And those are, Mr. Chair and as well, those are exempt from the height restrictions for certain districts.
Where it becomes a commercial is when a wireless provider, your AT&T, your Verizon, make them out there and co-locate on it, then it becomes a commercial facility.
But those, that would otherwise be allowed.
I am not looking for work around to be asking the question.
So, is it possible then for a commercial provider to go to John Doe's citizen and say, fine, put up a ham radio tower and then we will co-link onto that.
Is that permissible under what we have here today?
I believe that would fall under the definition of co-location because any existing tele structure is eligible for co-location under the proposed change in the ordinance.
Is there any way to prohibit the abuse of using ham radio towers or such which are intended for private use to be put it in for potential commercial use by somebody else?
I believe Mr. Williams actually just stepped out.
Mr. Chair might be able to lend some additional information.
But now we can wait for Mr. Williams as that's appropriate.
Because of this conversation we've had, I wasn't playing and asking this, but these are some issues that were raised by this public hearing that I'd like to hear about.
Mr. Reddy, do you want to take that?
Or Mr. Chair, either one?
Let's walk through the door, sorry.
Mr. Williams.
Supervisor Dunn, would you like to reiterate your question?
Mr. Williams trying to defeat the echo from the television in the hallway I failed.
So Mr. Williams, in the public comments we've had, there are a couple of issues that were raised that I have a question on.
You heard my comment, or you may or may not have heard my comments, saying if a person has a private ham radio tower of greater than 50 feet, that is not included in this issue, then the question was raised.
If a commercial entity said I'd like to co-locate receivers on that tower, would that be considered commercial?
Mr. Klein said no, that's considered still to be private.
Then we had a gentleman here in the public hearing who made the comment that we're implied.
That if a wireless company went to John Doe's citizen and said fine, we can put up a tower, call it a ham radio tower, and then we will call it with you.
That essentially a work around it. At that point in time I am having some concerns going outside the parameters of what I think the intent is and how to address that.
So that's one. For all of you listening to this, I think we're all aware that in the western part of this county we need high speed internet.
But in the eastern part of the county, it's a different situation, so trying to balance this out as Mr. McCartney said one size might not fit all is what I'm trying to do, and that's why I'm asking the question.
So Mr. McCartney, if you can answer that, sorry Mr. Williams, if you have to, I appreciate it.
The under the current county zoning ordinance for those districts in which towers, personal towers are allowed, then co-location of commercial facilities on them would likewise be allowed essentially under the current.
The new state law, what the state has basically said is the 50 foot towers have to be allowed regardless, and well really for whether for commercial or not.
So I think Mr. Dunn your question probably relates mostly to the existing ordinance, and is I understand it right now the private towers would are not currently by right in the RP district.
And also therefore in the R5 district because that district uses the RP standards.
So if we pass this, can a commercial entity turn around and say to John Doe citizen, hey, let me just put up a hand tower here, because that's not the intent here.
I don't believe this changes that because this simply allows, this would allow any 50 foot tower for any premise to begin with as long as somebody has a 50, whether it's commercial purpose or so I don't think this would actually affect that aspect of the county.
If John does this, I want to put up 100 foot hand radio tower.
Can he, or would you have to go then through the CUP process?
The 100 foot hand radio tower would be allowed in the RA district regardless of this ordinance.
In the RP district, it would.
I'm sorry, no, not in the RP.
And in the RP district, the answer would be if I wanted to put up 100 foot tower in my backyard, I'd have to go through a CUP or I would prevent that correct.
Okay.
Some of this deals with circumstance too.
I mean, I don't know how common, quite frankly, hand radio towers are, but if we had a proliferation of them all of a sudden that coincidentally had internet equipment on them, that becomes suspect.
So if you're a legitimate ham to ham radio operator with a tower and you can show that you're ham operator, then there's no problem with the tower.
But if all of a sudden tower start going up and an internet provider just happens to be at the same time hanging equipment around them, that becomes suspect.
And that's what I wanted, that's what I'm trying to address.
Mr. Klein, is there anything in addition that you want to either add from your perspective?
I think Mr. Williams clarified it.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you Mr. Sherman.
You know, questions of staff or discussion?
So again, what we're doing here is bringing air code into conformance with the state code.
And the super resume card is indicated that I think there still needs to be some work on this because it does not address the provision of broadband or fast internet service.
And there's served underserved portions of the county.
So it's no more just as well.
If I may, I would just like to, my district is Opeckin.
I ain't like that, Opeckin.
Anyway, in Opeckin we're probably the most densely-grouped housing district in all of Frederick County.
And I don't need all those towers in my district and my folks don't need them either.
We're right around the 81 corridor and everybody has what they want.
But we also realize our fellow citizens out in Stonewall and out in Back Creek and Gainesboro, they need that.
And we want you to have that, I want you to have that.
The only thing that I want to do, and Supervisor McCarthy and I were talking, I want it to be able, and however we get it, whether it's working with towers or working with more suppliers of internet service, we need to do that.
We need to get that done.
It should be a top priority.
But I would like to see it where we can set up some areas and say this 150-foot pole doesn't belong in the backyard of a housing district with 150 houses that just got built.
And it just happened to be a vacant lot.
And they said, can you put a house on it? Guess what? We can put a tower on it.
And I just don't think that's fair to those residents.
We're in favor of it. We'll figure it out. We want to get it done. We want to get done as quickly as we possibly can.
Because it's just not fair to the folks out there, not to have that.
So, anyway, I think the Supervisors all of us are working very hard to figure out how to get that done.
And I don't have a problem with this as long as we are moving in that direction, like you said, to get everything done for those folks out there.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Any other discussion?
Mr. Chairman. And so, for Mr. Wells, you laid out the issue very clearly.
That's the issue that I'm dealing with as well. So, I second your comments on that.
Thank you.
All right. Let's vote. All those in favor. The ordinance amendment has proposed to the Brisbane City of Frederick County zoning ordinance.
All second five is saying aye.
Aye.
Mr. Chairman, we need a roll call.
Roll call.
Yeah, Mr. Chairman, we need a roll call on an ordinance.
Although, I'm sorry.
Roll call vote. Supervisors done.
Aye.
Supervisors will.
Supervisors slaughter.
Supervisors McCarthy.
Aye.
Chairman Bootsay and the motion passes.
Supervisors McCarthy.
Mr. Chairman, thank you.
I'd like to make a motion that we direct staff to work on an amendment to the ordinance we just passed, which would allow for heights up to 100 feet in the areas west of I-81.
And to include the lattice towers and also consider or suggest consideration of lowering CUP fee filing fees for any towers that wouldn't comply with those with those ordinances.
You heard the motions there, second.
How about the second to that motion?
Discussion.
Mr. Chairman, just for clarification, because this is directing a potential new ordinance for Mr. McCarthy's motion, that is also a motion to direct the planning commission to have a public hearing.
And send something back to the board.
Thank you.
We'll have a resolution that reflects that.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Supervisors slaughter.
Discussion.
On the motion.
I would also like for planning to look at the Stonewall district because I have had comments from citizens of Stonewall that there are areas in our district that there is no internet as well.
So it may not be everything to the west of I-81.
We probably need to look at other areas in Stonewall district as well.
Thank you.
Supervisors McCarthy.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So the reason I think it's kind of obvious that I brought up this motion is that, you know, if you live in Gainesboro district and you have children that are in school or they're homeschooled or you have a job that requires you to use the internet.
Or you commute to talk to mute.
We just can't get that ability and most of Gainesboro.
And I know in your district factory it's very similar.
And it's a distinct disadvantage to the citizens that live in those areas.
So we have a real problem that needs to be addressed.
It's a real important issue.
And I understand the concerns that some have about, you know, line of sight or view shed and those types of things.
And those are issues too, but I think we have to prioritize what's most important to the issues that are being brought forward.
And from what I hear from my constituents, you know, when it comes to being able to keep up with your education, compete in the workforce, have access to the communications and the information that you need in today's world, I think that takes priority over things like
will one home be affected by a tower being put up beside it because that tower may be service serving, you know, a dozen or scores of other people in that same community and giving them what they need in order to compete.
And all they're doing is asking to use their property in a way that will benefit them and their neighbors.
Some of the comments that have heard tonight regarding the in this goes to the supervisor Dunn's question regarding the ham radio towers is, you know, you can put up a ham radio tower and a tower is a tower.
A hundred foot ham radio tower is no less of an infront or pending site than a 100 foot internet tower.
So if we allow towers for one, why do we not allow towers for the other? What makes ham radio legitimate versus internet? Why is internet not legitimate when you consider that?
Internet is much more, in my opinion, much more necessary in today's world than ham radios.
Don't get me wrong. Ham radio is playing an important part, especially in emergencies, but on a day-to-day basis, Internet is a lifeblood anymore of our commerce and our economy and our children's education.
I think we need to recognize that. And we shouldn't leave Gainesboro and Back Creek behind just because there are a few, especially on the eastern side who would say, I don't want to see that in my backyard.
That's the reason why I really think it's important that we move forward with allowing these types of towers, at least in those districts that have these extreme.
I would like to go and just make this judgment, Mr. McCarthy, that not only west of I-81, but wherever we are in Frederick County and address the issue.
The gentleman here made the comment earlier that we're trying to provide high-speed internet for the county as a whole.
I think, I would assume that that's something that we want to achieve. And so whether you're west or east, parts of Stonewall, parts of other areas, perhaps, need that as well.
So I think we can look at this as a way to solve a bigger problem. It helps everybody.
The second thing is, if this motion years passes, I would encourage planning to move on this rapidly, not delay it, so that they can move on it as rapidly as they can and not have delay of a year.
But if they can get this done in a 30, 60, 90-day time frame, that would be extremely helpful to solve the problem now as opposed to just pushing it down.
There are comments. I would just add a comment, too. I agree with Supervisor McCartney's assessment of this, that the Comcast, the Verizon's AT&T's are not going to be the ones providing internet service to the serve, non-served areas of the county.
It's going to be those wireless providers. And I think we really need to find a way to take into consideration their needs, their ability to serve the community, and the community's needs not to have something obtrusive at something that might degrade the value of their homes, and I'm sure staff can get that worked out and bring it back to the board.
Any other discussion?
Mr. Chairman, the motion, Supervisor McCartney's motion, was to increase tower options west of Interstate 81, and I know Supervisor Dunn and Supervisor McCance Lawyer made additional comments.
There's a state law provision that says in order to make a change to a zoning ordinance, the board has to initiate the process by a resolution directing the Planning Commission to study it, have a public hearing.
I want to make sure that any ordinance that might come out of this has been properly chartered, so to speak, by the board in the first place.
So I don't know if any of the Supervisors want to offer an actual amendment to Supervisor McCartney's motion.
This is a question.
So, are you suggesting that we amend it to make a resolution in order to initiate an amendment to?
The motion can be formed into a resolution, but it's more in terms of what the scope of it is.
So, as if the ordinance ends up broader in scope than what the board authorized sending forward, we could have a potential problem.
If I may, Supervisor McCartney, would you like to withdraw your motion?
No, sir, I'd actually like to make a comment based on what the County Attorney just stated.
The people of Gainesboro brought this issue up over a year ago.
I know you and I are working on this and expecting something to come forward over a year ago.
The process of trying to figure out what's going to work in this small pocket versus the needs of an identified part of our county.
It makes sense that let's take care of the people that we know first.
And then if we still need to take care of some other folks later, let's continue that process.
Let's continue to discuss that and take care of them.
But I don't think it's fair to the people of Gainesboro and Back Creek to continue to extend this out while we do more investigation on what could be when we know that there are people who are being affected by this.
So that's my only concern is for the people of Gainesboro, we need this now.
We don't need to wait any longer.
We know it's needed.
We need to study to tell us that it's needed because we don't have internet to look at the study to find out what it says.
So on behalf of the people of Gainesboro, I just want to say we need at least to take care of our folks on the west side now.
And then if we need to continue it, I will support continuing that discussion.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. President.
Do you have any objections on just simply taking your motion and simply saying, and where else needed?
By doing that, I think that that does not preclude anything, and I would support you when trying to deal with Back Creek and Gainesboro.
But then it gives staff the opportunity to say, here's another area, not to delay it, or to give staff the opportunity to say, our highest priorities are Back Creek, our highest priorities are Gainesboro.
And that comes forward in a short time frame, and then they say, but we have some other areas that still are an issue.
It gives them the opportunity to come back and do that at a later date, not forever, but, you know, so I'm trying to work something that...
If I understand the county attorney correctly, I think he's saying we need to be more specific in what's to be part of this proposed ordinance, is that not correct?
Yes.
I mean, if the motion were a supervisor, done suggests, I mean, staff could come back with something narrower, but it does put staff in a bit of an awkward situation in terms of trying to define something to bring back to the board quickly.
And my concern there is, if staff is charged with looking at what other areas there are, that takes time for them to figure that out, which will delay the eventual adoption of this amendment to the ordinance,
which will then continue to affect the children and the folks and the northern part of Frederick County that don't currently have access.
So, Mr. Williams, if Mr. McCarthy's resolution passes as is, which is just west of I-81, is there anything that prohibits us in either a week or a month from coming back and saying a similar resolution for elsewhere in the county, or similar resolution for other specific areas that Mrs. Soder may have some concerns,
or are I, or Mr. Wells?
The board could certainly come back next month with such a motion.
And those would then run concurrently, is that correct? If it were passed?
I mean, the first would come first, and the second would come first, so I understand that, but it's not to preclude that week against Rose just to add if that's an issue.
That can be done. I think they wouldn't necessarily be concurrent because this discussed this one sort of as being put into pipeline sooner, but that's they could both be done in somewhat of a similar cycle.
Okay.
I don't want to speak for staff, but I would think that it could.
Any further discussion? Supervisor Latter?
My concern is that the citizens of Stonewall should be given equal consideration in this process.
There might be another alternative here, is for the board to make two separate motions now.
And with the understanding that the west of Interstate 81 motion will be handled first will be given priority.
I think I don't know that that makes sense to me, is your concern that you don't want them to have to wait before they're considered?
I think that the whole of the county should be priority. I don't think that any citizen should be treated any differently then.
Mr. Tierney.
I see you.
I really hesitate to wait in, but I'm wondering if by simply making 100 foot towers by right, I think we're all assuming that suddenly we're going to get 100 foot towers because they're now by right.
And I think there's economic reasons why towers aren't going up.
So one thought I have is that we revisit our fee. We charge $7,500, I believe, for a CUP for a tower.
To me, that's probably as much and maybe more of an obstacle to someone putting a tower up than going through the CUP process.
I've heard some concerns about where these towers go. The CUP gives the board still some control about where towers go.
So one simple thing that you could change very quickly is just eliminate or reduce dramatically your fee for that CUP.
You still give the neighbor's protection of having a public hearing and going through a process where you evaluate them on a case by case basis, but you dramatically reduce the investment and the cost for someone to put one up.
It's just a thought.
I've actually considered that and I actually include that in my emotion was that we should consider that as well.
My concern though is that the average citizen does not want to have to go through the red tape of coming before this board with the CUP application.
It's one thing for a provider to have done this over and over again, but if a landowner wants to put up a tower on their land and ask for CUP,
maybe some people may be chilled from doing it or they may just go ahead and put them up anyway.
To me, we have a need. I think Chris is right that you won't have a bunch of hundred foot towers. You may have some 50 foot towers.
You may have some 60 foot towers. You're going to have towers that just get above the tree line enough so that a radio signal can get to it.
So it's not going to be the Eiffel Tower sticking up over Apple Pie Ridge.
So it just doesn't make financial sense. No one wants to spend money on aluminum or steel that they don't have to spend money on.
So to me, this is an issue of priority and government tends to drag their feet. And I think we have dragged our feet on this for a long time.
So I just like again to reiterate that if we can get it done and gains borrow and back creek where the two supervisors seem to be in agreement, it's needed.
If the rest of the supervisors for their districts don't think it's appropriate, I'm willing to support any of you who doesn't think it's appropriate.
And I'm willing to support another motion to help Stonewall achieve the same thing.
I just don't want whatever is happening on the east side where we're trying to figure things out to affect what's happening on the west side where things are known.
But we already know that there's an issue.
If you have a fire, you put out the fire, you don't look around and say, are there any other fires to put out? That's kind of where I'm coming from.
But I know that we have issues in Stonewall as well, just as you do that, that we are not getting service as well, that I have people that are reaching out regarding their children not being able to have internet service.
So it's not exclusive to games.
And that's why I would support that we look at the entire county as a secondary motion so that they both can be done at the same time.
But it's not going to hold up putting out the fire that we know exists while we try to find where the fire, the other fire is.
That's my thought on that.
There could be a second motion that said east of 81 or anywhere in the county.
We can look at the rest of the county.
Okay. Any more discussion? Does this need to be a roll call vote?
I think it's just a motion. It's not a public hearing issue, right?
This does not have to be a roll call vote.
Okay. All those in favor of Supervisor McCarthy's motion. Please signify by saying aye.
Aye.
Those opposed?
Is that the aye. 81?
That's west of 81.
All right. Chairman votes aye.
The motion carries. Is there a second motion?
I would like a motion that Stonewall be apart of the study that we look at that district as well.
Who east of 81?
Is there a second that discussion on that motion?
Okay.
All those in favor of Supervisor slaughter's motion.
East of 81.
By the same.
I will get some time to talk about revisions that my concessor to about the service signify by saying aye.
Aye.
All those opposed?
Chair.
Chair.
Chairman votes aye.
Motion carries.
Do you have public hearings.
An ordinance amendment to the Frederick County Code, chapter 165, zoning and Article 2.
Supplementary use regulations.
Specifically revisions to the Frederick County zoning ordinance to improve consistency.
within certain sections and to clarify or reduce requirements for certain uses, Mr. Clanaghan.
Bear with me one second.
I can walk through the amendment while this comes back up.
It's been on a long time tonight, so let's give it a second and come back up.
This is a, I'll walk through it, and I'll pull back up the slides as to not delay the meeting any longer.
This is a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance to improve consistency within and between certain sections of the zoning ordinance and to clarify or modify requirements for certain uses.
I'll walk through the amendments that I'm going to cover, and then I'll walk through each amendment individually.
Specifically, these amendments are proposed to the following sections.
Storage facilities, self storage, tractor truck, and tractor trailer truck parking, special event facilities,
off street parking and parking lots, landscaping requirements, and buffer and screening requirements.
As it pertains to storage facilities, self storage, the proposed change is to improve consistency with landscaping and planting requirements regarding plant size and this section with other sections of the zoning ordinance, and it modifies the screening requirements that do not otherwise meet the intent of the section to screen the use.
As it relates to tractor truck and tractor trailer truck parking, the proposed changes prevents the citing of the use adjacent to residential uses while enabling the location of these types of facilities where they are most appropriate, i.e. adjacent to major roadways or in the vicinity of other business and industrial uses.
It also provides a consistent hard surface standard for the use allowing operators to choose either gravel or paid parking that is consistent with the temporary nature of the use.
It also changes in this section and improve consistency in the landscaping and planting requirements regarding plant size and this section of the ordinance with other sections.
I think Mr. Ruddy has pulled it back up.
Can I do apologize for the device going out?
As it relates to special event facilities, the proposed changes provide clarity with certain practices in the county specifically that the building official with the department of building inspections is responsible for determining if a building or structure that is existing.
As it relates to the off street parking and parking lots requirements, the proposed changes provide consistency with the required width of driveways serving parking lots in this section with other sections of the zoning and subdivision ordinance and the county code, specifically the fire code.
In addition to the landscaping requirements, the proposed changes provide consistency with plant size in this section with other sections of the zoning ordinance and further clarifies the requirements to prohibit plantings from being located within utility easements and it eliminates certain invasive plant species.
Finally, as it relates to the buffer and screening requirements, the proposed change modifies what activities are allowed in the inactive and active distance buffers, modifies landscape screen planting requirements, amends the requirements for buffers with a land to be developed as adjacent to a state road right away with a B dot designed functional classification of interstate arterial or collector roadway.
Amends what zoning districts are allowed to request a reduced buffer distance if certain requirements are met.
The development review and regulations committee discussed this item at their July 25th August 22nd and September 26th regular meetings and the committee supported the proposed changes.
The commission discussed this item on October 2nd and the board of supervisors discussed this item on October 9th. The planning commission held a public hearing on November the 6th and the item was forwarded to the board with a recommendation of approval.
Following a public hearing this evening, staff is seeking a recommendation from the board of supervisors on this proposed ordinance amendment.
Staff is happy to answer any questions you have and thank you.
Any questions of Mr. Clyde?
Not thank you, Mr. Clyde.
Open a public hearing for an ordinance amendment. It's Frederick County Code, Chapter 165, zoning Article 2, subject amendment to use regulations, specifically revisions to the Frederick County zoning ordinance to improve consistency within certain sections and to clarify or reduce requirements for certain uses.
If there's anyone who would like to speak to or are against the proposed amendments, please come forward. Give us your name, Magistral District, and let me just comments three minutes please.
Seeing none, we will close the public hearing.
First, how would you like to address this item? Mr. Chairman.
I would move for adoption of the proposed ordinance amendment.
There's an emotion to adopt. Is there a second?
Second, Mr. Chairman.
Discussion.
No discussion.
Do I roll call vote? All of those in favour of favour of the ordinance amendment as proposed and read?
Supervisor Dunn.
Hi. Supervisor Slotter.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Chairman Votai.
And the motion passes.
Thank you.
Board Lee is on reports. Are there any?
Citizen comments.
Citizens who would like to comment on any issues addressing the board, please come forward.
State your name. Magistral District, and limit your comments three minutes or less. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Board of Supervisors.
I would like to, my name is Lynette Emory. I'm a representative of the Shawnee District.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Chairman and Mr. Lofton for your 12 years of service to the Frederick County Board of Supervisors.
You have worked tirelessly and researched endlessly for out-of-the-box solutions.
Many times to be met with, but we've always done it this way.
You've rarely missed a Board of Supervisors meeting or any meeting of a committee on which you served, including finance, technology, economic development, transportation, planning commission, and social services.
Sometimes you have been met with harsh criticisms, and many, many times you have been met with, I thank you.
So tonight, I want to say thank you for a job well done, and I want to say I'm very proud to call you my dad, and I love you very much.
Thank you.
Anyone else? That was really hard to follow along.
She gave me the hardest job of it.
Hi, I'm Mr. Schneller. I'm a senior at Shrine High School, and I'm also voting in the Opec in District.
Mr. Chairman and Mr. Board, Mr. Wells. I did get the first sheet of vote this year, so I was pretty happy about that.
I would like to bring the attention, again, thank you for your service here. I know you're being a place, but I kind of want you guys to get started out next year.
I'm looking ahead. I feel the need, the candidates that we have voted, I feel, do not represent the back.
Mr. Sean Graber, he has probably said that, you know, he wants to take funding away from the schools, and I've seen that as an issue.
So I kind of want to get you guys thinking now, before the break, before the new year, before the new, people come up to the board, think about our school system.
I know, personally, I've been affected. I've been it for 13 years. I've lived my whole life here.
There's been a year at Toronto where we had to decide whether we want to heat the school or fix a bathroom.
That's an issue. That's a big issue. When you're not giving kids a place to use the restroom, or you either have to do that, or cut from their heating and air conditioning one year, it was 98 degrees in the school.
That's not a great learning environment for the students, and especially for the teachers who are working endlessly every day to make sure that we are getting the best environment that we are.
And before I go to college, I know this won't affect me in six months, because I'll be in the land of, you know, high freedom, as some people say in college, hopefully making the best of myself.
I hope that the students who are coming after me have a better place to learn and be educated than I did.
I'm not saying you guys have done an awful job because I've done a great job. I just hope that we can do an even better job for our students in the future and coming up so we can make this county one of the best counties for our student education.
Thank you. Thank you. Anyone else?
David Williamson, Gainesburg District. I'd like to just have a quick follow-up if I could.
I wanted to address amateur radio terraces. They seem to be a topic tonight.
State code 15.2-2293.1 placement of amateur radio antennas. I just want to read a couple of highlighted sections.
And this is 1998 when this passed in Richmond. And localities having a population density of 120 persons or less per square mile according to the, to 1990 United States Census.
No local ordinance, shall restrict amateur radio height to less than 200 feet above ground level as permitted by the Federal Communications Commission or restricted number of support structures.
Reasonable and customary engineering practices shall be followed in the direction of amateur radio antennas.
Our current code where it says permitted use for a radio tower of the RA district, I believe that the people that originally wrote that code meant that for commercial use where it says permitted use radio and television towers.
I don't believe that they meant to preclude someone in an R5 or an RP district from being able to put up a television and amateur radio tower. So it encouraged that that needs to be looked at.
I brought up the topic of the certified letter that we had one of our customers that was sent just this past, we December 4th.
I would ask that in light of the decisions that have been made here at the board tonight that you would take under consideration asking the zoning department put to put a stay on any further enforcement with this particular customer with their 100 foot tower that they owned that they allowed us to co-locate one.
Well, there's been a decision made on whether 100 foot is going to actually pass or not and that was Joel and Kimberly Grant at 292 Chimney Circle in Middletown and I'm sure the zoning department can give you some further information on that. Thank you.
Thank you.
Anyone else?
Thank you.
Board of Supervisor Comments.
Very often.
No, please don't do that.
I'm sorry. He's just don't get to choose this time.
It's locked and has served on our board and done a great job.
And I just want to congratulate him on all the things he's done in the past and wish him the best in the future and it just goes without saying.
You've been a friend of Frederick County for a long time and you've done what's right for Frederick County.
Thank you.
And that's what's in his heart is doing what's right and I'm very proud of had the opportunity to serve with him on this board.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
I just want to end light of what the supervisor well said.
I know you had wanted to be the chairman and I think you did a fine job tonight as the chair.
So I'm glad you were able to go out doing what you always wanted to do.
As a newer supervisor on this board, I can tell you I appreciate so much your willingness to always be accessible to me and I know to other supervisors.
Our job is we can't do them in a vacuum and I think it's so important that we work together and I hope that the new board members coming in will realize that there's a lot of give and take.
There's a lot of discussion.
There's a lot of consideration that goes into the decisions that we make and I appreciate that you've always been willing to listen and consider before you make decisions.
I think that's what makes a true statesman and I think that's what you are Gary is a true statesman.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, it will continue.
Mr. Chairman, I've enjoyed working with you.
I've enjoyed your willingness to stand when everybody else has said no.
I've been willing to appreciate the fact that you've listened and changed your mind.
I appreciate the fact you've tried to represent the people from that creek well.
All of them.
I appreciate the fact that as you know I have had discussions, you've listened and changed your mind.
I've listened and changed my mind.
It's fitted to a street.
I've enjoyed working with you.
I really had Gary.
I look forward to working with you in the future.
I wish you the best as you continue to live in Frederick County.
You've made a contribution to the county.
I think we all need to appreciate that.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
All these remarks, but I certainly have had the pleasure of serving on numerous committees with you and I know how hard you work.
You have to serve all of the citizens of Frederick County.
So thank you for that privilege.
Thank you.
And now I'll take my turn.
Thank you very much for the kind words.
It has been, I have been truly blessed.
I feel that way to be able to have served the people of Frederick County, especially back creek.
I truly say my prayers every evening.
And I thank the Lord for the blessings He has given me.
The opportunities He has given me.
And I've tried to make the best of them.
It has been my extreme pleasure and honor to work with such upstanding, hardworking individuals like yourselves who have the same I feel values within you that I did.
And that is you truly want to serve the citizens of Frederick County.
And may I say, as he provides or done, has pointed out, we don't always agree.
But I really appreciated the fact that we could agree to disagree.
None of us took it to heart.
We just understood that the stance you took was different than the one I took.
It didn't make you wrong me right.
It just said that we feel differently about these subjects.
And that we had some good honest debate and some good discussion.
And I hope, and I know I don't hope.
I know the citizens of Frederick County have benefited from the service that you all have given them.
And the others that I have worked with in the past have also seen their plans, their hopes, their dreams of Frederick County realized through the ongoing work that this board will continue.
Also the staff.
I couldn't, you know, I was in local government for over 30 years.
And I have had to give kudos to the staff that's here today and to cut staff of Frederick County.
I don't know that we could find better individuals with the knowledge, the skills, and the heart to serve the citizens of Frederick County.
We are so blessed to have you all and I want to thank you all very much for that.
It's truly amazed me over the years, the amount of work, the industriousness of our staff.
And I can name a few, but that would be, I couldn't name everybody.
It would take all night to do that.
But again, let me just thank you from the bottom of my heart for all that you do for the citizens of Frederick County and especially putting up with me for 12 years.
That was probably the hardest part of your job.
And now you can give a little sigh of relief and wipe that brow and say, okay, it's going to be an easy roof now on.
But no, but again, thank you.
And despite what you might think, I didn't tell my daughter she would lose her inheritance if she did not.
Again, I'm true to the best as we all are with spouses and children who understand our mission, our zeal, our passion for doing this.
And they've spent many a lonely hour at night, just like tonight.
And yet they still support what we want to do because they know it's a real passion for us.
And so, to all the spouses, to all the children, thank you all very much for your support.
I think that's what makes us all tick and all run.
And especially the people who actually come out and say, thank you for what you've done.
That shows you that your service is truly valued and is a benefit.
So, again, thank you everyone.
Thank you, good lord, for giving me this opportunity.
I hope I have served him well.
I hope I have served the citizens of Frederick County well.
And I wish everyone a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Here are the comments.
If not, I'll entertain a motion to adjourn.
Miss, I miss that.
Go ahead.
Mr. Chairman.
