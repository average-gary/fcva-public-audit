I think all of you received, I did receive an email letter from the President of the Lord's Fairfax Community College
extroling the great relationship between the Lord's Fairfax Community College board
that has had with Mr. Mike Lake and expressed her support from the board to reappoint Mr. Lake to another term.
Does my personal feeling that when the President took the time to personally request the reappointment?
The board of supervisors had certainly take a look at that and support it.
As we are aware our educational institutions are undergoing major changes due to the coronavirus
and I personally feel that keeping continuity is very important and that now is not the time to make
this change. Thank you sir. Thank you. Further discussion, anyone? Mr. Chairman, I would concur with Mr.
Lake. I think he has done a good job. Mr. Monk is an educator. He has grown up in this community.
I think we will make a good contribution and I believe that the letter that was written that
the supervisor was mentioned was written prior to Mr. Monk making his application known. Thank you.
Further discussion, anyone? Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. I'd just like to read a little bit of
Brandon Monk's experience. He's currently the senior manager for Skills USA which is a lot of
career and technical education. If you look at his past, he has worked extensively in education,
extensively in leadership development and extensively in the trades. I had the opportunity to
speak with Mr. Monk today and I believe he has a lot of good ideas to help blend some of the needs
and challenges that our students need in today's environment with some of the trades and things
that could be afforded through the Lord Fairfax Community College program. I believe it would be
very beneficial to have someone of Mr. Monk's caliber and his leadership experience in FFA
and trades on that board. Sometimes someone has done a good job in a position and someone else
comes along with a new perspective that can be both enlightening and helpful to advance the
cause of educating our children and I believe that Brandon Monk's experience speaks for itself as
each of you had the opportunity to see his resume. So I'll leave it at this. I can think of no
better person than Mr. Brandon Monk to represent this board on the Lord Fairfax Community College Board
because of his educational background, his working with youth, his entire adult life and as you
look at his accomplishments and awards, you can see he has many awards for being in advisory
programs for bringing on many boards of career technical education. I think that that would be a
wonderful attribute for him to bring to this board. Thank you.
Thank you sir. Further discussion anyone? Mr. Chairman. Yes sir.
Mr. Fajram-Carth. I would just concur with Supervisor Gravers' comments as the former member
for Frederick County representing Frederick County on Lord Fairfax Community College Board.
I know the importance of coming with fresh perspective and new ideas.
For Lord Fairfax Community College is at the cutting edge of our community college system in
Virginia. It's one of the very best in this state and it's showing it's a showcase for other
college systems across the country as to how to do things and integrate all different types of
education for folks in both rural and urban areas. I think Mr. Monk has a fresh perspective,
has some great ideas on how to integrate new programs with the the local schools. My experience
with him has been one where it seems that he always puts the children's education first. There's
nothing that he puts ahead of that as far as what his goals are working through the school board.
I think he would be by far the best choice for this position. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Thank you sir. Any further discussion? Anyone?
Supervisor Graver. Aye. Supervisor Dun. Aye. Supervisor Wells. Supervisor Slaughter.
Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Fisher. No.
Have great respect for Mr. Monk and his skill set. Sure he'd make a great representative,
but I am going to vote no and entertain an additional motion.
Motion to nominate Mr. Lake for reappointment to the Lord Fairfax Community College Board for his
second term. You are limited to consecutive terms.
Or the motion deserves second. Second and second. Second and second. Any discussion?
Anyone? Supervisor Fisher. Aye. Supervisor McCarthy. No. Supervisor Slaughter.
Supervisor Wells. Supervisor Dun. Supervisor Graver. No.
Chair votes aye. Motion carries and Mr. Lake will be reappointed to the Lord Fairfax Community College Board.
Proposed amendment to the physical year 2021 budget. Supervisor Dun. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
A month ago we all voted for a budget and I voted in the affirmative and one of the primary
basins I voted in the affirmative because the tax rate was being left at the 61 cents.
We've had a 7.5% increase per year for the last four years that I've been on the board and
that's been significant. About a week after the board voted Mr. Tierney did the wives thing
on trying to make some cuts in the anticipation that we may or may not have the revenue.
The purpose for this amendment is to go and cut $4.8 million from the post budget until
we know that we have the revenue and we may not know that we have the revenue until
maybe January of this coming year. That $4.8 million represents the natural growth
that would have occurred in Frederick County under a normal business circumstance. However this
is anything but normal. Retail sales are down we get a portion of that. Meals taxes are down we
get a portion of that. I don't know what's going to happen with real estate taxes for those people
that are unable to pay the real estate taxes so all those are concerned to make. On the county
side the administrators or may make cuts of about $2.8 million. This $4.8 represents a $2 million
cut on the county side a $2.8 million cut on the adjustment on the school side if we keep the
same $57.43. Not knowing whether we're going to have that money is the reason that I made this
suggestion and if we do have the money that we can go with the budget that's listed but I'm not
confident that we have. I mean if you take a look at our meals taxes they're down 25-30%
in the last month you've had a number of stores have gone bankrupt or filed for bankruptcy.
You've also had a situation where you have high unemployment and so there's a host of reasons
there there's a financial planner I'd be very hesitant to go and make a promise for something I
can't keep. Finally if the revenue is worse than we anticipate we are still on the hook for the
monies for next year so I'm doing a suggesting the $4.8 which means that the budget for this
coming year FY21 would be the same dollars as the budget for FY20. The schools were also meant to get
approximately $3.9 million in additional revenue in FY21 over what they would have had or
what over what they did receive in FY20 and so if that occurs that accommodates for this $2.8 million
on the school side so that's the purpose for the amendment and our appreciate your support.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Oh to make in a motion?
Oh sorry sir. So I would like motion to reduce the budget to amend the budget by $4.8 million
until we know that we have the revenue at which time the board will make the decision
on reinstituting the additional monies.
Thank you. Motion in a second is our discussion.
Any one?
I don't mind considering if I'd like to have some time to think about it, Mr. Chairman.
I'd like to take a look at it so I'm suggesting that you would like to delay action.
I would like to postpone this until our next meeting that would be mine.
I'm not making that as a amendment just a suggestion.
I'm sorry sir.
As you're done. How would you feel?
Let me make a comment. This app reported this.
One of the commitments were on the core values of Frederick County.
I'm quoting is a government that is accountable and dedicated to providing responsible
stewardship for county funds and to ensure the citizens receive the best services possible
for the funds required. I'm open to a postponement to give those that want to further
delve into this opportunity to do so. I'm glad to do that.
For the record, I gave everybody here on the board and I think it's in the packet.
By reasons why I wanted to do this, I was laying out the thought pattern behind that.
If somebody wants to discuss that thought pattern, it's fine.
But my concern is that instead of getting the money we expect, if we end up with $10-15
million less, then we're going to have to eat that. And we also have an additional
possibly $15-20 million for a 911 system that we have to deal with. We have approximately
$250 million of capital requests from the schools in the next five years.
Some of which are really important. We have additional capital requests coming from the county.
And so I just would like to have a good feel on what our revenue streams are
before we make commitments that we will not be able to
adjust once the money has been authorized and appropriated.
I'm good. Your motion, if you're willing to
withdraw it for a future consideration, please do so.
Mr. Chairman, I want to ask Mr. Wells.
So Mr. Wells, if this came up in that our next meeting,
it's not going to be that comfortable. All right, I'm willing to go and withdraw the motion
for until our next board meeting. Thank you, sir. I assume that second can occurs.
Thank you, sir. All right. And I would ask, write it out so that the motion actually goes
out with the agenda next time. Please. I thought I'll be glad to do that. I thought that I thought
that the motion that the wording is included in the existing motion. But I'll be glad to do that.
All right. So we'll delay action on that one
until a future meeting next one, which I assume will be the first one.
June 8, I believe, Mr. Chair. Yes.
All right. That will bring us to
one special report. I'm sorry. I think we need to have discussion and vote on that.
Don't we have as a motion in a second amendment?
You withdrew it in the second concurring. I'll withdraw. Second concurres will have this
discussion in two weeks that gives other board members a chance to go and think through it
further, have discussions, whatever is necessary. We have time. So that's okay.
Okay. We good. Thank you. Thank you, sir.
Scotion, pressure, event center, conditional use permits. Supervisor Dyn.
Mr. Chairman. In the last couple of years, we've had at least four requests for special events
centers. And they've come under different circumstances. In one case, we had a person
who had bought some property. They both were working second jobs. They said to me,
the reason we don't want the special event centers to generate additional revenue,
so that we don't have to work our second jobs. And there was no farming done on the activity.
They had the land, but there was no farming per se. We've had another situation in which
a person has come to us and said, I want to run a special event center. The board said no.
The person then ran additional events after the board said no. The board then came back and
gave a 12-month exception to that. But there was no penalty for saying no. I remember some
waste guts in the room where they are at the time. We also have the hypothetical situations,
which are more than hypothetical, of a person going and buying a farm. That farm is by
an elderly person with no relatives that want to sell their property. Somebody knew buys the farm
and says I can put up a special event center and generate some place between $3,000 and $15,000 per
event. If you run one of those every three weeks, that's an additional revenue stream with no
farming activities. So the purpose that I like to have is a discussion is for this board to have
a conversation with the planning commission. We can sit around the table and have a conversation
and say, what's appropriate or not appropriate? I've said the comments before. If you have a
special event center and you're running a wedding out of it, what's the difference between that
and by having a bike factory fixing bikes inside a barn, so it looks the same and having some
people come periodically to fix their bikes and drop those bikes off, which is a commercial item,
which currently is not appropriate in a rA area. So I just like to have the conversation,
what we as a board think and as a community think is appropriate. One of the comments is going to
be currently the area west of I81 is designated as rA. Is it the intent of the board to say over time
we want to make that into RP or industrial etc. Or do we want to keep it as rA? I spent this morning
going through a farm for a solar project that would come up before the board. The gentleman has
a few thousand acres of land and wants to put 300 acres into solar. He's trying to preserve his
farm. If he had said I want to run an event center instead, that would have been appropriate.
So that's the conversation I want to have. So we as a board have some consistency as opposed to
each case being decided on some merits. It's just important, but is there a reason to have
our special event centers in a rural area appropriate, not appropriate, if so under what
circumstances, that's the conversation I'm looking to have. We don't have anything proposed,
but that's the purpose for a discussion point. If you're okay with it, I'd like to comment.
I'd love to have your comment and others comment. Yes, please.
Okay. I mean, I'm not opposed to having a work session with the Planning Commission,
but I do think that what we have in place works. So a special event center requires a CUP.
So it's a case by case discussion. They build a special event center.
If they cut hay on their farm as well, they can qualify for land use taxation on the land,
but they pay full taxation on all improvements, including special event centers. A lot of those
are really expensive buildings. We have a process for your bike repair business to locate inside
your barn so that it doesn't generate all the same things apply. You need to satisfy V.com ants,
et cetera, et cetera. To my knowledge and memory and all the time I've been involved,
we've never approved a year festival permit except to give people a chance to work
at their issues with V.com with other considerations in their application.
Have some of them forgotten or weren't aware to make that application and go through that
process? Maybe. Maybe they weren't. Maybe they were aware, but irrelevant in that we're giving
our citizens an opportunity to present their best case for good decision making. Mr. Chairman,
just a different thought. One of the reasons why I want to have a broader discussion,
and that may or may not be the consensus of the board, so that's fine.
Is that if farmer A, farmer B and farmer C all put in special event centers,
if farmer D says I want a special event center and we say no, how do you justify that? That's
one point. The second point is if every farmer in the county, because that's where it seems
to be coming from, instead I want a special event center and they were all approved. Does that
then change the nature of that R.A. area where instead of having 200 people or 300 people going
to one special event center, you have 200 to 300 people going to multiple event centers
at the same time, does that change the characteristic of the R.A. area? That's the reason.
Not as much as your R.P.s. I understand that. I understand that, but that's the reason I was
putting this forward in this discussion, at least from my perspective, it may or may not be
the consensus of others, but if we approve three or four and all of a sudden we do not approve
five and six, and if I'm farmer five or six, then I'd like to say why if you approve these,
so by putting some parameters there, that's the purpose for this discussion.
Okay, you raised your hand to be the last guy in line that has to make those decisions based
on all the information that's come out through the application process. Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir. Mr. Fuzma-Carth. While I'm not laser focused on the event center as the
major issue, I think it was December or January when we met with the planning commission,
I had suggested that we do have a retreat like they used to have with the planning commission,
just to talk about the future of the county. We're a different county than we were 20 years ago.
We need to talk about what the future of the county looks like, what the swas is going to look like,
where we want to see development, what is Stonewall district going to look like in the future,
as property rule properties get bought up, what is Gainesborough district going to look like as
the city starts to encroach out into the rural areas for the eastern and southern part of
the counties. A lot of those decisions have already been made just by virtue of development.
There's still a big question about what is the north, the west, and the north east side of the
county going to look like, and I think it would be a good thing for us to sit down with the
planning commission and have some discussions about what we want our county to look like,
things like what are we looking for as far as residential development, how that impacts our
county into the future, and what are our expectations for how that's going to be managed in the future.
I sat down with Mr. Ruddy, I want to say it was almost a year ago, because I had some concerns
about CUPs in relation to country stores, and Mr. Ruddy's staff came back with some really good
changes to the ordinance, and I think that was a good start to a process to discuss, you know,
how are these CUPs and rezoning, and what are the, you know, the planning districts within the
county going to look like into the future. So I concur with supervisor Dunne maybe for different
reasons, but I concur with him that I think it would be a good time for us to get back together
as a group within the county with the planning commission and start having those conversations.
So I would support supervisors, Dunne's requests that we ask the planning commission for a date
to meet with him sometime within the next few months. I am completely good with that. We used
to have some really good discussions in those retreats, so I have no objection to that.
I'll follow that, Mr. Chairman. You know, the comment? I think we're going to need
to wait and see how our situation evolves, but still we'll put it on our list of things to work
toward. Good idea. Does that, Chairman? Does that need the goals? Could Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir. Can I ask if we set that up, is it for the special events that are conversation,
or do you want other items added to the list for a broader conversation?
Open items might be a good idea. I just want to be sure I understood. I'd ask others to
chime in on that. I think that we ought to ask what other subjects there are that people would have
that we might want to touch on at the same meeting or at successive meetings. We can send
something out and try and query the board, rather than do it here if that works for you.
The other comment is suggestions? Mr. Chairman? Yes, sir. Supervisor Fish.
Well, I'm kind of hearing here something that we used to do with the Planning Commission.
It's kind of a review of the comprehensive plan of the county.
You know, if you're concerned about the rural areas and the special events,
and if you really want to change the rural areas, we've changed the one dwelling for five acre
lot, and that will save the R8 land if we want to change that one. That's just a specific example.
But I think going along with Mr. Tierney's question, in what I heard Supervisor McCarthy say,
that perhaps a comp plan review might be just a general terms with the might satisfy what I'm
hearing. Thank you. Thank you. Just a comment. We do continue to update our comp plan on a regular
basis. This I think the goal was more to focus on things that we needed to discuss more immediately,
which might help guide amendments to the comp plan. Is that anyone else?
Hearing no one, thank you for the discussion. We'll move on.
Brings us to the Finance Committee, Supervisor Slotter. Yes, sir. The Finance Committee met on
May the 20th last Wednesday. The agenda is before you, and items number two, three, five, eight,
nine, 11, 12, 13, 16, 19, and 20 were approved on Committee's consent agenda, and I would still move.
The motion is there a second. And a second. Is there any discussion?

Hi. Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Fisher.
Hi. Chair votes aye and the motion carries. Item number one, the parks and recreation director
requested general fund supplemental appropriation in the amount of $118,883. This amount represents
proper funds to construct a trail around lakeside lake behind the Bowman Library. This item has
been approved by the parks and recreation commission at their March 11 meeting. The committee
recommends approval, and I would so move. Second. Motion in a second. Is there any discussion?
Hearing none, Supervisor Fisher. Hi. Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Slotter. Hi. Supervisor Well.
Supervisor Dyn. Hi. Supervisor Graver. Hi. Chair votes aye and the motion carries.
Item number four, the transportation director requested development projects fund, fund 27,
supplemental appropriation in the amount of $2,253,614. This amount represents change orders and

Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Fisher. Hi. Chair votes aye and the motion carries.
Item number six, the Winchester Regional Airport Director requested an airport capital fund
fiscal year 21 budget appropriation in the amount of $2,334,000 and a general fund
supplemental appropriation in the amount of $414,376. Representing the local portion,
362,000 of the local portion is a carry forward of unspent fiscal year 20 airport capital.

Supervisor Slotter. Hi. Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Fisher. Hi.
Chair votes aye and the motion carries. Item number 10, the fire and rescue chief,
request a general fund supplemental appropriation in the amount of $81,474.73 pending grant award.

Hi. Chair votes aye and the motion carries. Item number 14, the finance director
request of fiscal year 21 Northwest Regional Adult Detention Center fund balance reduction
in the amount of $440,000 $10. This amount is from the elimination of the merit
COLA and the budget when it came over included the percentage of merit COLA and this is just to bring
the county books into line with that. So we are recommending the elimination of that and it would
be a fiscal year 21 budget resolution reflected the reduction for the county share of the amendment.
The committee recommends approval and I would so move. Second. Ocean in a second, is there any
discussion? Supervisor Graver. Hi. Supervisor Dyn. Supervisor Welles. Supervisor Slotter.
Hi. Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Fisher. Hi. Chair votes aye and the motion carries.

approval to apply for the BJA grant for a 3D scanner was authorized. The committee recommends
approval and I would so move. Our demotion is our second.
Second. Anyone?
Freed your motion dyes for lack of a second.
That will take us to item number 18. The chair for request a general fund supplemental
appropriation in the amount of $15,397 and $22 cents, $11,998 and $80 pending receipt of funds.
This amount represents overtime reimbursement from the DEA no local funds required.
The committee recommends approval and I would still move. Second.

All right. Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Slotter. Supervisor Well. Supervisor Dyn.
Supervisor Grave. Chair about time. The motion carries.
Item number 21. The chair for request a general fund supplemental appropriation in the
amount of $21,078 and $58 cents. This amount represents reimbursement from the IRS for overtime,
travel, vehicle maintenance and equipment. No local funds required. The committee recommends
approval and I would still move. Second. Motion in a second. Any discussion?
Supervisor Graver. Supervisor Dyn. Supervisor Well. Supervisor Slotter. Supervisor McCarthy.
Supervisor Fisher. Chair about time. The motion carries.
The last item. The chair for request a general fund supplemental appropriation in the
amount of $80,000. This amount represents an expected shortfall for overtime, local funds are
required. The committee recommends approval and request staff to work with the sheriff on factors
contributing to the overtime. The motion is there a second. I'll second. And a second.
Is there any discussion? Yes sir. I'm going to vote for this because from what I understand
even if the board voted no you still would have the obligation to pay the $80,000. So a no vote
and a yes vote are going to end up with the same results. But I'd like to consider going and
having this return to the committee. And the reason is this is an $80,000 expenditure and overtime.
That represents money through the middle of May. I would expect that we've already spent over
$40,000 and overtime above budget and the total overtime budget right now is 1.12 million
through the middle of May. I'd like to see if the finance committee, staff and the sheriff's office
can work together, try to figure out a way to go and reduce this overtime budget issue
for this year and for next. I know that we're going to have to pay this $80,000. But a
million overtime expenditure is huge. In the FY20 budget we have $16.7 million in the
sheriffs of which there's approximately $645,000 budget for overtime. In the FY21 budget
it's a $16.1 million budget with $700,000. That's a $55,000 increase. And I know that they're
officers that work hard and work long. But I'd like to see if the sheriff's office, the finance
office, the finance committee can consider to work together to see if there are ways to reduce
that. For example, take a look at what the comp board requires for a community of 90,000 people
which we are and see if the officers that we have here meet that requirement. Are they too many
for that requirement or not enough? That's one point. Second point. If an officer is on a shift and
he's picking up John Doe's speeder at the end of his term, can he go and have a person from
the second ship finish that or not? If he can not, then if he works in extra 50 hours a week one,
he can only work 30 hours a week too. So for the two weeks the comp time compensates for that.
I don't have an answer here, but that's something that you know ought to be explored.
The third issue is that for officers that
visit county buildings, private buildings, etc. Make sort in the door to a lot to the
center. I understand the sheriff has said, I'd rather have officers go and do something as opposed
to nothing if they're on patrol. I think that's good. So Mr. Millhorn, that's a good comment to
make to use those officers wisely. On the same time, if that is considered then into overtime,
then the question becomes, is that a cost effective tradeoff? And again, that's something I don't know.
So I'd like to see if the chair of the finance committee is open to having this go back to finance
to see if the finance committee, the sheriff's office and our finance committee can work together
to find ways to reduce the $700,000 in an overtime budget is huge to me. That's represent a
5% increase. And if we can have that more closely, I'd be more comfortable than just saying $80,000
today without any constraints on that. This is a deal breaker if any committee can spend money
and then expect the board to cover them on that. Finally, on this, I understand that we have
money in the contingency fund that would cover this. So if we have a transfer of money from
contingency to the sheriff's office as opposed to an appropriation, it would come out of the FY20
budget to the best of my knowledge. And if we can go and have this money then go into next year's
budget for the sheriff, but next year's budget is still capped at 16.1 million and you'll have to
figure out ways within his own budget to absorb this $80,000 or potentially more because we don't
have the end of the year and we potentially will have overtime for the last two weeks of May,
the month of June, and that might run another $50 to $100,000. So for that reason, I'd like to have
it considered going back to finance if they can work it out and maybe come back to us in July,
first week in July, which I know is FY21, but according to what I've been told by staff,
they can still go back and pay for money in FY20 and go from there. If we have questions
about, I know Mrs. Schiffler is here to address that. Just a couple of comments.
Staff did work closely with the sheriff's office, try to find it in his, that money is not in his
budget anywhere. They also attempted to predict his use toward to the end of the year. I don't
object in to having this discussion again, but staff, that number should get him all the way to
to the end of June, June 3. It's no guarantee, but they worked really hard with them and trying to
help them understand better what they've been doing and how they've been budgeting and how
they've been managing their time. Mr. Chairman. Yes, Mr. Farros McCarthy.
If supervisor Dunn's comment was a motion to amend to basically allow this to be applied
in next year's budget, under the sheriff's budget, rather than as a supplemental
appropriation for this year, then I have second his motion to amend the motion.
I didn't hear a motion at all. That's my question is if it was a motion, and I would second that.
I'll make it a motion, and I'd second it.
Are we okay?
You ask. So what you're doing, so what you're doing is whatever number that we end up being the
the number that has to be funded in his budget, you want an FY21 reduction by the like amount.
That's correct. Okay. I don't know if we'll have all the answers by next month,
but we'll work on it. So the current budget for next year is approximately 16.1 million.
That's correct. And so I'm just saying that the budget cap is still 16.1 million.
That these dollars can go and the sheriff can work out within that budget.
These additional dollars that are there. And then if we all can work together on this,
I think that it helps everybody. We're going to work with the sheriff. Sometimes people in the
sport have political differences, but I think we all want to go and work together. And this is
just trying to solve a problem so that everybody wins. So part of how about 80,000 was determined.
It was a spreadsheet that we had that we were trying to predict how much was going to be left.
So we are still paying expenditures in July. So I'll have to see how all those expenditures
work out to see if there's balances left or they over that or they under that before I can
tell you if that 80,000 is a good number. So that's going to put me in August.
And I'm open to that if that works for you. Yeah, I just want to let you know the timeline.
That's fine. So I mean, if we address this in July, that's fine.
You can answer the question. I mean, the $80,000 may be a good number according to Mr.
the chairman, but it may be short. That's correct.
This was explaining how that driver got put together. Right. That number was staff's best
effort to project what it would end up being.
What are related to your other comment? Comp board authorizes us to have more deputies than they pay
for. And we actually do have more than the comp board recommends or or recognizes, let's say.
That's fine. I'm just fine. I mean, I'm just trying to solve this problem. Just information.
Okay. So we have a motion to amend and a second. Sir discussion. Mr. Chairman.
Yes sir. Just adding one to what has been spoken already. There's been some concerns that
folks have brought to me. My constituents have brought to me regarding the overtime
sheriff's overtime budget and some of the things that have been listed in the newspaper.
Some of those has been the responsibilities of staff. And while we are in no way
authorized or able to tell the sheriff how to manage his staff, some of the concerns that
were brought forth were what are or what have the sheriff's resource officer has been doing?
Have we reallocated them? Some of the other things that have been asked of me is, is why
were we at our budget as far as budgeted overtime? I believe it was in January and what
that was supposed to be for the entire year. I've had a couple of previous employees come and
say that they felt and it has been maybe an unspoken that this was a push to try to get more
deputies and I don't know if any of that is true. But I do believe as Mr. Dunn has supervisor Dunn
has laid out here that if we allow one agency to continue to push a budget whether it be the
sheriff's office, any other agency that we open ourselves up to other folks believing that
the budget is simply a guideline and we can do what we feel is necessary and I believe that
that is a slipper slope to get into. So I appreciate your time.
Thank you, sir. Further discussion? Anyone?
Mr. Chairman. Yes. The only thing I would add to that is that the instructions from the
finance committee were for staff to go back and see if we can find the reasons why we're in
the position that we are in and hopefully spend more time looking at the current budget and if we
can make adjustments there we would do what is Mr. Tierney said this was their best attempt
giving the information they have. So in hearing supervisors Dunn come and I certainly don't
think there would be any harm in us having it go back to finance committee having better
information that we have the complete amount of what we may or may not need to address this issue.
I know there's a motion on the floor in a second but I'm wondering if it would be prudent
for us to take the time to understand where this disparity, how this disparity has arisen
and address it accordingly having the full picture.
Further? Yes. I concur. I mean I'm looking to solve a problem so I concur with those comments.
Mr. Chairman, if I could, it's certainly my desire and I know the desire of others to understand
what's driving that overtime number. At this point in time we don't know and simply because we
haven't really had time to delve into it this went to finance as you know last week we've been
aware that that numbers exceeded last year and exceeded significantly what we don't know is
what what is the cause what what's different. So we we being myself Ms. Schiffler or HR director
and we will involve the sheriff obviously it's my desire and our intent to sit down and try and
sort this out and figure out what's driving it because if we don't understand it there's a good
chance we'll end up in a similar situation in this time next year and obviously none of us want
that. Yes. A little motion on the floors or further discussion.
Supervisor Graywood. Aye. Supervisor Dyn. Aye. Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Slotter. No. Supervisor McCarthy. Supervisor Fisher. No. I'm going to vote now. We
are going to have to pay this money so the motion fails. I would entertain another motion
if you would like but we're going to have to pay this and we're going to have to pay it in a
timely way. Mr. Chairman I think there's a motion on the floor that was a vote on the motion to
amend. I think there's a motion on the floor currently that was proposed by Supervisor Slotter.
Motion to amend. We just voted on the motion to amend. Yes. So now we vote on the new motion.
I think the original motion was what came out of the finance committee Mr. Chairman. It is.
I think that's the one that Supervisor McCarthy was kind enough to guide me back from.
So the current motion is the motion of Supervisor Slotter at the recommendation of the finance
committee to approve and request that staff work with the sheriff on factors contributing to
over time. So further discussion on that motion. Yes.
I mean, Supervisor Slotter. Chairman I still would go back to what Supervisor Dun has said and I
really don't believe there would be any harm and I was having all the information and facts
before we move forward with any appropriation and hope that maybe in working with the sheriff
that we'll be able to address this disparity. So if August, Mrs. Schiffler, could we come back
with a supplemental appropriation in August to address if we needed to?
So are we postponing until August, are we bringing it back in August once we get a more
final number or whatever that date is? Is that, is that what you're doing or asking to do?
So that money is going to come due before that, isn't it?
So it'll be paid. So when, so in August or September, we'll know where we actually ended
the final year and at that time we'll do a transfer to cover those funds and then we'll take
it back to finance committee to let everyone know where we ended up. Is that, and then you can
decide whether you're going to decrease FY21 at that time. So, Mr. Chairman, would this issue be
sought, the conundrum be solved with Supervisor Slotter just withdrawing the motion at this point
and allowing staff to figure out all of that out. It sounds to me like, Mr. Schiffler saying,
basically, we have time until August, basically, to get this all figured out.
We have time for you. You won't know for sure until at least. Right, until August or so,
on the end of August, we'll know.
Mr. Slotter? I certainly could wish all of that is the question and it has been asked by other
members. So we're trying to talk about this.
The second concurrence? Yes. And then we'll discuss the final numbers.
Is that what we're doing? Okay. Are we good? Yep, I'm good. All right, thank everyone for
their close attention. So this is a public hearing, non-planning issues. I adore festival
request of Tyler Wakeman, Peekleaf Music, and Brewer's festival. Who's presenting?
I've got it, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir. This is a festival permit application for an event to take
place October 3rd. That's a Saturday from 12 noon to 7pm on the grounds of 718-0 valley pike
in Middletown. This event, Mr. Wakeman, has held this if I'm not mistaken. I believe this would be
the third year. To our knowledge, the events been conducted in the previous years with no
mishaps or issues. So it's our opinion that everything's in order and we'll have it
to try and answer questions if there aren't any. Any questions? Hearing none, did anyone sign
up to speak? Yes, sir. No one. Thank you. I would the board like to handle the request.
Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. This is Back Creek. I had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Wakeman.
Had good conversation with him. He appears to be very responsible, very responsive and I believe
he tries to have the safety of participants at heart. Thus, I would like to make a motion to
approve the Peekleaf Music and Brewer's festival as submitted. Motion in a second is their discussion.
All those in favor, aye. Aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries. The festival permit is approved.
Bring us to CUP.
Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the board. This is
conditional use permit for JKL services. The location where the CUP will take places at
54 or 9 Valley, Mill Road, it's in a Red Bug Magisterio district in zone to RA. It's currently
used as assisted living facility. And this is the proposed use for any today's expansion
of that conditional use or excuse me, the adult care facility.
This application is for an expansion of the adult care facility. The adult care facility is
allowed in the RP zoning district or residence performance zoning district with an approved
conditional use permit. This facility was is operating under conditional use permit 0 to 96
for a 26 bed facility. This facility was constructed in 1996 using a community development grant.
Facilities currently operating under conditional use permit 2204. Now this conditional use
permit a law for a 5600 square foot addition to the facility. This addition was included in
a new physical therapy room in an additional residential room set of facility,
bringing the total facility to 34 beds. The new application that you're seeing to present
at tonight, Mr. Chairman, proposed to add six additional beds in the residential room into
the existing structure and able to structure to expand to 40 beds. Just for your orientation,
some Valamell road to map on your left. Silly, like I said, has been there.
This is the layout that was approved on the additional conditional use permit. Mr. Chairman,
basically what they're trying to do here at the Silly, they have an unfinished basement,
if you will, and they're just trying to add more rooms on it for this basement. They still
meet all our requirements of the original site plan in terms of parking and when staff. So that's
basically what they're looking to do. I should the Board of Supervisors find this use
to be appropriate. The planning commission recommend the falling conditions or review
as you comment so you can apply with it all times. Number two, the applicant must comply with
requirements of state, county, coast, pertaining to adult care facilities at all times. Number three,
any expansive modification that's conditional use permit require a new site plan and new conditional
use permit. The planning commission held a public hearing on this application on May 6, 2020
and the commission expressed value in the facility and to the community and
initially approved this conditional use permit. There were no public, no public comment period
that spoke before or against the application. Following the public hearing, staff is seeking
their decision from the Board of Supervisors on this proposed conditional use permit. Mr. Chairman,
there is a representative for the facility here to answer any questions you or any board members
may have. Of course, I'll answer any questions that you or board members may have. Questions
from Mr. Chair and anyone? Hearing no one, if you're representing, I'm sorry. I just want to
clarify, it's really not an addition. It's within the current structure we're just adding rooms
in the basement. It's correct, Mr. Wilson. Other questions? Who's president?
And to the best of my knowledge that you can confirm, there have been no complaints on this
facility. Oh, is that correct? That is correct. Actually, the last time they were in front of this
board, believe it or not, they didn't have a sign. It actually came for a sign that I think you've
seen out in front of your district, Mr. Dunsoh. No complaints at all. We've had no complaints at all
from the neighbors in that area. That's correct. Thank you.
Anyone else?
All right, applicant's representative? Is there anything you'd like to add?
No, I'm good. Thank you. Okay, questions of the applicant's representative, anyone?
Well, thank you very much, ma'am. Apparently, we don't have questions. Thank you.
Thank you, guys. All right.
Redbot, Mr. Chairman. I think that this type of facility is good. It helps people as they grow
in this community. Some of us are going to get old and some of us are good. Sorry, Mr.
Dunsoh, public hearing. Public hearing. Thank you, sir. I apologize. Sorry.
So did anyone sign up? Yes, sir. Did anyone submit comments? No, sir. All right. Thank you, Mr.
Chair. Mr. President, aye. Oh, this type of facility, I think, is important to the county.
It's a place to go when some of us become older or decrepit.
And they do a good job. I go by there, you know, four or five six times a week.
They keep their place clean. The reason I asked Mr. Schernd on that, I'm aware of no complaints at all.
So I would move that the CEPA be approved. Second. I should do a proof in a second.
Is there any discussion? Supervisor Fisher? Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy? Aye. Supervisor Slotter? Aye. Supervisor Wells? Aye. Supervisor Dun? Aye.
Supervisor Graber? Aye. Chair votes aye in the motion carries.
Mr. Stark?
It's a good evening, Mr. Chairman. This is
Master Development Plan O220 for Heritage Commons. And this is a proposal to develop 141.75 acres
of land zone R4 residential plan community property for a mixed-use community in the Shawnee
District. The properties subject to the Master Development Plan were part of a rezoning
application, number 1015 known as Heritage Commons, which is approved by the Board of Supervisors
in December 2015 with proffers. Directing your attention to the screen, the subject properties
are outlined in blue. They are generally east of interstate 81 and generally west of
Front Row Pike Route 522. And the property is bisected by the Cross River Boulevard,
which is currently under construction, which is a county revenue sharing project, which you all
are quite familiar with. And the subject properties are immediately north of the Madison Village community.
The Master Development Plan includes up to 645 multi-family residential housing units,
a minimum of 107,500 square feet of commercial development, right-of-way dedication for future
warrior drive extended, which is a north-south connector on the site. Preservation of the sensitive
environmental features on the property, Buffalo-Licoran, to be used for community recreation,
and future interpersonal connectivity with adjacent existing residential communities.
Again, directing your attention to the screen.
For orientation, interstate 81 forms the western terminus of the property,
and route 522 forms the eastern terminus of the property. And Cross River Boulevard,
which again is under construction, bisects the property. The area highlighted in blue is the
Buffalo-Licoran watershed, which is being preserved on the site to be used for recreation in the form
of a multi-use trail. And the dash line you see is future warrior drive, which will be extended north
south to north along the property. The project includes three landbays, land bay one, which is north,
the property north of Cross River Boulevard is to be used for commercial uses, including uses in the
B1, B2 zoning districts. Then you have land bay two, which is in the north of the watershed
in south of Cross River Boulevard, which is a mix of residential and commercial uses. And then south
of the watershed is land bay three, which is primarily used for residential uses.
The master development plan for heritage commons is consistent with the approved
rezoning application, proffers. And with the requirements of article eight, the master development
plans are the Frederick County zoning ordinance. And this MDP is in a form that is administratively
approval. The planning commission discussed the item on May 6th and offered no comments.
Again, this master development plan is presented to you all this evening for information
discussion. No action is required by the Board of Supervisors. And following the presentation
this evening, staff will proceed with approval of the master development plan. Of course,
we are happy to answer any questions you have at this time. Thank you.
Questions of Mr. Stein, anyone?
Comments, anyone? Would appear we're ready for you to approve. Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir. It'll bring us to a proposed ordinance amendments. Development review fees.
Mr. Stein. Yes, this is an ordinance amendment presented to you all this evening for
information discussion on development review fees. Again, this is a proposed amendment to the
zoning ordinance and the adopted development review fee schedule to reduce the fee for a
conditional use permit or CUP for commercial telecommunication facilities. The purpose of this
reduction in the fees is to encourage commercial telecommunications facilities to locate in
underserved areas of the county. In particular, those rural areas located west of Interstate 81.
You all will recall that in December of 2019, the Board adopted a two-track process for the review
and approval of telecommunication facilities in the county. This includes a by-right
allowance for towers up to 50 feet in height. And those would be reviewed and approved
administratively by staff. And then we have our standard process projects, which would be towers
greater than 50 feet in height. And those would continue to require a conditional use permit
before the Board of Supervisors. CUP fees for these types of uses were identified during
that discussion as a potential barrier to local service providers and individuals in applying
for telecommunication facility permits. The Board further directed staff at that time to
reevaluate the fees with the intention of reducing the fee.
Following that discussion, staff took the item to the Development Review and Regulations
Committee on February the 27th. At that time, staff proposed a fee for towers greater than
50 feet in height of $750. And that fee is consistent with the other CUP uses that are currently
listed on the development fee schedule. The Development Review and Regulations Committee
discuss the item that evening. And they recommended an alternative tiered fee schedule
based on the tower height, specifically for towers greater than 50 feet in height, and less
than 100 feet in height. The committee recommended a fee of $1,500. And for towers greater than
100 feet in height, the committee recommended that the $7,000 fee be maintained, which is the
current application fee. Subsequent to that meeting, the Board at your March 25th meeting
adopted a temporary code amendment, which expired on May 24th, that changed the conditional
use permit application fee for commercial telecommunication facilities from the current fee of $7,000
to a proposed temporary fee of $750. The Planning Commission discussed the item on May 6th
and did not make any specific changes to the proposed fee proposed by the Development
Review and Regulations Committee. There was no consensus among the Planning Commission
if a modified fee schedule with additional tiers differentiating between tower heights was
an appropriate remedy. And the Planning Commission generally supported the covering of real costs
to the county in reviewing, processing, and advertising CUPs for telecommunication facilities.
Again, in summary, county staff had recommended a fee of $750. That was consistent with the $750
fee that was adopted by this Board as a temporary code amendment that expired on May 24th.
The Development Review and Regulations Committee proposed an alternative fee again $1,500
for towers greater than 50 feet in height and less than 100 feet in height and the $7,000 fee
for towers greater than 100 feet in height. The Planning Commission further recommended that the
DRC fee be considered by the Board of Supervisors and they provided you all with a number of
comments which I've touched on this evening. This ordinance amendment is presented to the Board,
this evening as an information discussion item, and staff is seeking direction from the Board
under whether this ordinance amendment is ready for the public hearing and at what fee you all
would like for us to go forward with. I'm happy to answer any questions you have regarding this item.
Thank you. Questions of Mr. Stein, anyone? Mr. Chairman.
Supervisors McCartes. Mr. Stein, since the temporary fee was instituted a few months ago at $750,
how many applications for CUP have you received? We've received four CUP applications since the
temporary fee was adopted. As you all are aware, the Zoni administration has been addressing a
number of Zoni violations. In fact, there were 10 total violations for towers erected without an
approved conditional use permit for telecommunication facilities. Of those four have utilized the
reduced fee and applied for conditional use permit, and six of those have not proceeded with a
resolution to their violation. And of those four CEP applications, what districts,
medicinal districts, were those four applications from? I have to defer to Mr. Chair and on that one.
Three were in the accurate district of one game for all this. Thank you.
Other questions of Mr. Stein, anyone? Supervisors have done.
The purpose for this application fee is basically to cover the cost of the advertising, correct?
Correct. The fee, the fee typically covers the advertising, which is running the local newspaper.
One, notice for the planning commission and public hearing. One, notice for the board.
Supervisors public hearing, signage, and then any of the postage and supplies associated with
the mailings to adjoining property owners. Going back on a little history, the $7,000 fee
initially was set up because at the time the applicant would come to the board or the planning
commission, then the planning commission and the county would have to go and do certain
work to do that. Now, the applicant comes to the board with all that
architectural work and design work done, correct? Correct. So where I'm going, my question is,
if this design for covering the fee for advertising, is there any abuse of that system where the
applicant says, no, I'm not going to come today on month X. I'll come back tomorrow or next month
on month Y, which would that increase the cost to the county if the $750 fee were left alone.
Is there abuse of that or is there a way to rectify that where if the applicant withdraws his
or ask for a postponement, then the applicant shall pay for the additional cost where if somebody
else says, I have a question. So that's my question. I'll let Mr. Ruddy touch on that item.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Generally, there is not abuse of that system. What the planning
commission discussed was the fact that some of the larger towers came back multiple times because
of the public engagement, so they would have to advertise perhaps twice, sometimes more for those
public comments to be having, thus multiplying the cost. Several years ago, the board endorsed
a postponement fee for any public hearing of $500. That was to try and remedy what was
happening with rezoning applications and people doing just what you said tried to find the right
night, if you will, to get the application through. So I don't believe it is being abused in this
case. And there is a fee in place should a postponement be requested of a public hearing by the
applicant. I'm sorry, go ahead. So therefore, if the board approved the $750, but you have an
abuse, then there is a fee where the applicant would have to pay the additional cost for having
the additional advertising that would have to occur. Is that correct? That cost would cover
the applicant requesting a postponement of the application after it has been advertised for
a public hearing. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It doesn't help when the public concern, and it's a
pretty sensitive subject with our neighbors, would lead us to delay an action or follow a different
path to find a way to address those, then you'd have to still pay the fee, which is, I mean,
the jump from $750,000 to $7,000 is a little extreme, maybe. But I do think there should be a
step in there, I think. Mr. Chairman, thank you. One question for Mr. Klein. Does the $750
that we are presently charging for all other CUPs cover the costs or expenses that would normally
reasonably be incurred on a tower application? Yes, the fee would be closer to the $750
amount than it is to the $7,000 amount. Just so I'm understanding this correctly, and I believe
that I am. If that were to be postponed, we would have the additional $500 to re-advertise
if there was an outpouring of public support or not, the postponement fee is only in cases where
the applicant asks for a delay in the public hearing. If the planning commission were the
table action or the board were the table action, that fee would be paid for by the county.
Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. If you don't mind. The $7,000 figure
is sort of a vestige of the early days of these towers when there was a belief that the county
may have to go out and hire a radio frequency engineer to look at the areas served by the tower to
try and make sure that there was in fact a need for the tower in the location proposed.
I think what's occurred in the meantime is we found that clearly these providers don't put
towers up just for the sake of putting towers up. They put them up in areas where they feel they
can get customers and or there's a need. So what we had originally tried to cover the
thought of having our own engineer review these, we've never actually gone out and hired one,
but that is the genesis of that $7,000 figure just for what that's worth.
All right. Anyone else?
I feel that we should have at least one more step in there
or we're stuck below a hundred feet to let it go 300 without
a higher fee than 750 I think is wrong. I mean personally I think that we all descend
back to committee and have them work a tiered number. They had that discussion. They just
didn't reach consensus. I think that that would be worthy. Mr. Chairman. Yes,
surprise of a car. I read through both reports regarding from both the committee and from the
Planning Commission. It seems like the staff's recommendation each time is 750 covers the actual
costs of the application for the CUP. If our board or the Planning Commission says we're going
to postpone this, I don't think it's just to ask an applicant to pay the fee for us to take the
time to kick the can down the road because there's no guarantee there's no certainty and I think
that's part of the issue right now is people were low to apply for a CUP at $7,000 because you're
taking a gamble with your $7,000 that it may not be approved and now you're out $7,000.
One of the four applications that are in Back Creek and Gainesburg District, I've spoken with
the folks and this is a family that has a tower on their property. They didn't even realize that
it wasn't permitted. It was put up 12 years ago with NARA complaint and they said 750 dollars is
a lot but we're willing to spend it but I know that $1500 or $7,000 or some other number is just too
much for a family to pay to get a tower on their property. So if the purpose of this amendment,
as it's been stated, is to encourage the expansion of telecommunication into the western and
northern part of the county. I don't see anything that would compel us to increase the fees,
whether the towers five feet higher or ten feet higher if the actual cost of the county remains
750. I think both commissioners Thomas and commissioner Morris and hit the nail on the head when
they said if we raise these fees we're only going to discourage people from applying rather than
encourage people to apply and I think COVID, this whole tragedy that we're experiencing right now,
if this isn't enough to convince us that we need to do anything and everything we can within
reason to make it easy and inexpensive for people to get these types of telecommunication towers
put up and it's not like we had public comment where people were coming saying all these things
are going to pop up like Christmas trees all over the place. We've had four applications
since we've lowered the fee to 750. These things are going up as Mr. Tierney said where they're
needed and where they're wanted, you know, not just Willie Nilly wherever all over the place.
I just really feel like the 750 is the right number. I think the staff hit it on the head. I think
two out of just is why should someone who wants to gain access to what should now be considered
a public utility have to pay more than someone who wants to put a hair salon in their house or
someone that wants to put open a garage on their property. I think a CUP application fee at 750
makes a most sense and I feel like we're jousting it windmills when we're trying to figure out,
you know, should it be another thousand dollars higher here? How do we come up with that number?
How do we justify what the higher number should be and at what feet it just doesn't make any sense
to me. So I support the 750 sticking with that moving forward at 750. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for the comments. We're looking for a direction for scale. Yes. Supervisor
I'm not prepared to vote on this tonight. The question was, is what's being presented
ready for public hearing? Sounds to me it is not ready for public hearing. It needs to be sent back
with the appropriate comments from board members. It needs to be looked at. I think Mr. Tierney's
history lies in here and things get lost in history of why we went with 7,000 obviously makes
that number high and not reasonable. So I would, do you need a motion? Do you want a motion to
send it back? That's what I'll do or that it's not ready for public hearing. Whatever would be
appropriate. I'm looking for a consensus or a motion. Let me come back to your offer.
Okay. Fair. All right. Other comments. Mr. Duh.
Chairman, from what I understand on CUP fees, my thought process is that it covers our cost
of advertising, which according to staff is the neighborhood of 750. So I'm comfortable with that.
You may have some good reasons for having a higher fee and a listen to those comments,
but if the county recovers the cost of the CUP, then the applicant makes a presentation. We vote
yay or nay. So I'm kind of where it covers that cost. I'm good. And I'm not necessarily at this
point in time seeing the need for additional. I had a conversation with Mr. Ruddy earlier today
on this very issue. And so that's a 50 foot tower or less we can do it by right between 1,500 feet
or above 100. You then goes down to the question of what are we doing? It's not generating
revenue. Sorry. But we're just trying to go and figure out what the cost is for the advertising.
If that's paid for, we're good. Just a thought. Other comments, anyone? Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Ruddy. I believe we've kicked this can hard enough long enough. If COVID-19 has shown us
anything, it's the need for having adequate internet capabilities and wireless capabilities
for our children to learn. Just last board meeting, if memory serves me correctly,
we voted to appropriate funds to make some of our fire stations hot spots so that some of our
children can go to those stations to get the updates to their Chromebooks and other educational
things that they need. I know for several of the CUP applications that have been in my district,
those folks did not have a lot of money and it would be extremely difficult for them to come
up with a $1,500 or $7,000 application fee. I believe this wireless communications are a
public need. Therefore, I'd like to make a motion. I'm going to make a motion that we direct
staff to move forward with a $750 fee for this ordinance. To the public hearing.
To the public hearing. Thank you, sir. Second good card. Any discussion further?
Supervisor Graver. Supervisor Dun. Supervisor Wells. Supervisor Slotter. Supervisor McArthur.
Supervisor Fisher. No. No. Chair votes aye. Motion carries. We'll forward to public hearing.
Thank you, sir. Now we're going to propose to ordinance amendments.
Yes, sir. This is your last item of the evening. This is an ordinance amendment again for
information and discussion regarding zoning enforcement violations and penalties. This is
an amendment to the zoning ordinance to enact stricter penalties for zoning violations.
And presently, the county enforces the zoning ordinance through a misdemeanor process.
But state law also permits localities the use of civil penalties. If the county were to adopt
civil penalties ordinance for specified violations, state law would require the county to pursue
civil penalties for those violations up to an accumulated fine limit of $5,000 before pursuing
the misdemeanor process for those violations. The misdemeanor process with its authorize the
localities in the code of Virginia permits fines of $1,000, $1,500, and $2,000 for each successive
10-day period of noncompliance with an initial court directive to remedy a violation following
initial fine of up to $1,000 for a violation and a fine of $2,000 for every 10-day period of
noncompliance thereafter. The current county code does not reflect the above misdemeanor
fines that are enabled to the locality by the general assembly. If the objective for the
revisions of the zoning ordinance is to maximize the fines in such a way to create a disincentive
for violations, specifically repeat violations, proceeding sooner to the $1,500 and $2,000 fines
for subsequent 10-day periods of a violation remains the most effective approach.
The Development Review and Regulations Committee discussed this item on February 27,
and the DRC generally supported increasing the fees under the county's current misdemeanor
process to the maximum extent and the item was sent forward to the Planning Commission for
Discussion. The Planning Commission discussed this item on May 6th and also agreed with the DRC
recommendation to increase the fee to the maximum penalty permitted under the Code of Virginia.
The ordinance amendment is presented to you all this evening as an information and discussion
item, and staff is seeking direction from the board on whether this ordinance amendment is
ready to be sent forward for a public hearing. I'm happy to answer any questions as is the county attorney
Mr. Williams. Oh man, no questions. Well, we have a lot of folks who do the CUP process and do it
well and follow the rules and regulations. We have a few that just absolutely won't follow
the rules and I think it's high time that we take care of the bad characters if you will
and let them know they're they are persistently causing problems with CUPs and I think it's
high time that we whatever we have is a maximum that we can control that with I would support
greatly. Thanks, sir. You can't call me in anyone. Mr. Resard, I'm sorry, I come back.
I concur with Mr. Wells. I think that most of the people that apply for CUPs etc try to work
within the rules but there are people that say who cares about the rules. There's no there's no
cost to me or the cost is so minimal that simply cost to doing business. So I concur with Mr. Wells
and I think that anything they can strongly encourage I emphasize the word strongly is fine
and these in my opinion might even be too low but anything that we can do to make it more harsh
faster sooner. So it's clearly set that if you work within the rules we're good. If you
do not work within the rules we don't want that to occur and if you disagree with the rules come
to us as board members and say here's why I disagree and why we're opening that discussion
all of us but just don't flout violation after violation. Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman McCarthy. Chairman, thank you. I concur with both of the prior
supervisors comments. My one question is for the county attorney. Would you maintain prosecutorial
discretion with regard to filing of these types of charges so that we're not overtaxing our attorney's
offices? Yes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir. All right, Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir. I was the one that brought this forth originally I believe back in February and
had a follow up phone call on Memorial Day regarding this exact issue from someone who's been
dealing with this while I am very slow to want to see people tacked additionally,
essentially through a fine. I also understand that there are rules and rules must be followed
and the harm that it is at times is caused to others by people blatantly choosing not to follow
the rules can cause more heartache and grief in the community than is needed. So I concur with
what has been said I appreciate the support and what has been said and I fully support what is
been proposed. Hey, for the comments anyone? Chairman, I would move to advise staff to take this
to public hearing. Second. Motion and second is a further discussion. Hearing none. All those in
favor aye. Aye. Aye. Opposed aye. We'll forward to public hearing. Yes sir. That was Mr.
Mr. Mr. Frishers. Oh, okay. I'm sorry I thought it was Mark. I understand.
Well I thought Board Liaison reports are they're ready? Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Mr. Fryser, well. Yes. Parks and Recreation staff introduced a plan to reopen the recreation
facilities and programs and parks and recreation commission at their meeting last night. This included
but it's not limited to the pools, shelters, playgrounds, athletic fields, camp and basic wreck.
They are planned to open with restrictions once Virginia enters phase two and three of the
governor's real name play them. The Parks and Recreation plan will comply with the recommendations
from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Virginia Department of Health, Virginia
Department of Social Services and specifics of the governor's safe at home guidelines.
One significant difference this summer will be with the pool admission for general swim.
Parks and Recreation will be offering several two hour periods of open swim at each pool
anticipating a 50 person phase two facility capacity. There will be no admission fee collected
on site this summer patrons will need to register for their time slot either online or by
calling Monday through Friday before coming to the pool. Facility reservations and program
registration information will be available on the website after the date and details of phase two
are announced by the governor and that's the specifics of what they're doing. I'd like to say that our
Parks and Recreation staff have worked very very hard to open things up for folks as you know
the hiking trails are being used extensively now. We have a new bike park over at
Cerando which is exciting it was in the paper if you haven't had a chance to see it
participate in that if you're a biker go out and have some fun and ride it right over it
it's being well-used and accepted by all. So again congratulations to my parks and recreation
people they've worked tirelessly to come up with some great ideas and hopefully we get the
phase two and be able to implement some of these. Thank you sir. Supervisor Doug. Mr. Charmin
let's report on two things once the library the library is met and they do not have a date yet
for June but they hope to open in June they have an internal committee to determine what that
date will be what the parameters of it will be to go into the library so hopefully the library's
will open in the next couple couple couple of weeks. Secondary is the tourism committee tourism
has been hit bad in this community hotels motels and those that generate their income from tourism
have had kids of 40 50 60 percent so with a gradual reopening they hope to make
Frederick County Winchester a destination point for those people in Washington DC or Pennsylvania
or elsewhere to come just to enjoy this area for Patrick line for the battlefields for all
town etc so they're just trying to work to make certain that the businesses in that area can start
to have some liken them by attracting people to come for the tourism. Thank you sir are there
liaison reports any? Thank you. Citizen comments did anyone sign up?
No sir we don't have sign-ups for the second period I don't know whether we have someone waiting
now. We do? No we do not thank you. All right board of supervisors comments are there any?
Supervisor died. Mr Chairman. We're all dealing with a COVID-19 issue is having a devastating
effect on businesses. I was talking to a barber yesterday and his comment to me was I don't
control my business the governor does. That barber has to have an appointment to go and say him
so you can just not walk in and see him where you have to go in and make an appointment and if
you cancel the appointment the barber's then income just goes down he said no business at all
for 10 weeks. Governor Northroom if you hear this keep this thought in mind your executive
water says there can be no waiting yet if the office does the opportunity to be six feet apart
with a mask but your executive water prevents that I'd ask you to rethink that and say what can we
do? I went to church with my wife we were six feet ten feet apart from other people we were
in a congregation of a hundred plus people and we were fine so this no waiting needs to be revised
Governor Northroom you're being paid a salary it's not personally you I know you're trying to do
the best for the community but people that have lost their jobs need to go back and work and we
can all go and make the judgments on what is a risk or not risk to do that but this state needs
to be opened up thank you mr chairman thank you sir anyone else or comments
vice chairman well chairman that would move we adjourn vice to adjourn all those in favor are I
hi no thank you Jay hope you're feeling better hey mark when you have a good night mr
sir thank you
