I?
Supervisor McCarthy?
Supervisor Fisher?
No.
Chair votes no, but motion carries.
We will not renew.
All right.
That will bring us to Board of Supervisors comments.
Are there any?
Mr Chairman.
Supervisor McCarthy.
I want to keep it brief as I know if we want to get through this meeting
as efficiently as possible.
But there's been something that's been on my mind for several weeks now
because of the pandemic.
I think just off the discussion we just had, there's a very short
piece that was written by CS Lewis, a famous English author
during the time when the atomic bomb had first come on the scene.
I just want to share that real quick with the folks out in
Frederick County.
I've changed some of the words obviously from atomic bomb to
virus, but I think it's pertinent to today.
In one way, we think a great deal too much about coronavirus.
How are we to live in a pandemic age?
I'm tempted to reply.
Why is you would have lived in the 16th century when the plague visited
London almost every year?
Or is you would have lived in a Viking age when Raiders from
Scandinavia might land and cut your throat any night?
Or indeed, as you are already living in an age of cancer, an
age of paralysis, or an age of terrorism?
In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty
of our situation.
Believe me, dear Sir Madam, you and all whom you love were already
sentenced to death before the virus was discovered.
And quite a high percentage of us were going to
die in unpleasant ways.
We had indeed won very great advantage of our ancestors and
aesthetics, vaccines, and antivirals.
It is perfectly ridiculous to go on whimpering and drawing
long faces because the scientists have added one more
chance of a painful and premature death to world which
already bristled with such chances and in which the death
itself was not a chance at all, but a certainty.
This is the first point to be made and the first action to be
taken is to pull ourselves together.
If we are all going to be destroyed by a virus, let that
virus, when it comes, find us doing sensible and human things,
praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music,
bathing the children, playing sports, chatting with our friends
over a pint of beer, not huddled together like frighten sheep
and thinking about viruses.
They may break our bodies.
A microbe can do that, but they need not dominate our minds.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Sir. Any other comments?
Anyone?
I just have one.
With regard to the intersection at Old Charlestown Road and
Martinsburg Pike, the developer has advised the transportation
director as of this week that surface improvements will begin
the week of June the 15th, and that has been coordinated
with misutility, so I just want to make the folks out on that
end of the county aware that that will hopefully weather permitting
start next week.
Thank you.
Other comments, anyone?
All right, thank you.
That will bring us to committee appointments.
Community policy and management team.
How would the board like to handle that?
Mr. Chairman, I would make a motion to approve Dawn C.
Robbins as the parent representative for the community policy
management team.
Second.
Motion in a second, is there any discussion?
Supervisor Fisher.
Hi.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Claude.
Hi.
Supervisor Well.
Hi.
Supervisor Don.
Hi.
Supervisor Graver.
Hi.
Chair votes, aye.
Motion carries.
Development impact model oversight committee.
It is time to repopulate that committee.
There are recommendations in our agenda.
How would the board like to handle this?
I would like to approve.
Mr. Chairman.
Motion to approve.
Is there a second?
Second.
And a second.
Is there any discussion?
All those in favor, aye.
Opposed?
No.
No.
Supervisor McCartney.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
So we'll reappoint those folks.
Frederick Winchester Service Authority.
Wellington Gens, after 46 years of dedicated and distinguished service
to Frederick County does not wish to continue to serve.
We have an application from Gary Oates for that position.
And then the other potential appointment is Mr. Wilkins.
And he is a joint appointment with the City of Winchester.
So that would go from us to Winchester.
I would like to approve.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I would move that we appoint Mr. Oates and Mr. Wilkins to serve.
Second.
And a second.
Is there any discussion?
All those in favor, aye.
Opposed, no.
We'll reappoint those two folks and send our recommendation to the city for their consideration.
We'll bring us to proposed amendment to the physical year 2021 budget.
Supervisor Dun.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
A month ago, we passed a budget.
And we expected to have approximately 4.8% of natural growth.
With the items that have occurred in the last two months,
I questioned whether that $4.8 million of natural growth will actually occur.
And it was for that reason that looking at it from a financial viewpoint,
I'm wondering what happens if we don't?
If we don't meet the revenue extremes that we expect to have,
then we'll have to go into our either general fund or someplace else to go and get those monies.
By putting this $4.8 million reduction,
it will give the county the same money that they had this current fiscal year,
which will end June 30.
It will give the schools the same money that they would have this current fiscal year.
It simply withholds $4.8 million until the board fully knows
that we will actually receive the revenues that we think we will receive.
And so, for that reason, Mr. Chairman, I move this board withhold $4.8 million
until such time as the board of supervisors makes the determination
that the expected revenue will actually be received.
Okay.
Motion is second.
Discussion.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
Supervisor McCarthy.
I support this whole hardly.
This was one of the concerns I brought up during the initial budget discussion.
At that time, we were assured by the county staff that we could count on the money coming.
Eight days later, it was decided that we may not have that money coming.
So, I think the county minister wisely decided to hold back on some of the expenditures
that might have been incurred had we moved forward full force with the budget that was passed.
I think that that was a wise decision and I think that this is in thinking with that
that we need to wait until we see what occurs.
We have numbers that came from our finance department that shows that tax revenues
from businesses in certain areas spiked during the pandemic shutdown.
Those are mainly in the areas of our grocery stores, our big box stores, which of course we all know
that we are not going to be able to do so.
So, everyone ran to the grocery store and bought as much as they could.
So, that's a natural and obvious thing to see happen.
Same thing with the big box stores when you're stuck at home.
And you see all the stuff in your house has been broken.
And you've been meaning to fix for years and years.
And now you suddenly have a bunch of time.
You're going to head down to the local big box store and start buying the stuff you need to fix those things.
So, I do think that the increase that we saw in those revenues are not going to be sustained
because once people start getting back to work, they'll be shopping less at lows
and fixing the stuff around the house.
I'm not sure that people will continue to hoard and buy more food than they need or more toilet paper than they need.
So, I am concerned that with revenues down in our restaurant and hospitality sector
with the rates numbers and the big box stores and the grocery stores probably getting back to normal.
And we're saying quite a lot of news coming out right now with spikes in people not paying rent or mortgages
that real estate taxes may take a hit and we may not see the results of that until January of next year
when the second half of the year's taxes come due.
I just think it makes sense to hold off when spending any money or allocating any money
or guaranteeing any additional funds to the school board and in us having to dig even deeper
and to the county are administrative side of the budget in order to find the funds that we're promising.
So, I'd rather us live within the means that we know we have until such time as we know we have the money to spend additional.
So, I support the motion.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Further discussion?
Thank you, sir.
Further discussion, anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Bob Book.
I kind of agree.
We just talked about the legislative process that we can come back to it at any time and make those decisions.
And I feel the same way about this.
Thank you for giving me the time to study over this.
I feel like we can make these decisions.
We don't have to do it here today.
We don't have to make a shot right now that we can keep an eye on this as we have.
And when the time is appropriate, if that occurs, then we can make this decision that we're talking about right now at that time
and this board has done that before.
So, I don't see the need to do this immediately at this point.
Mr. Chairman.
Further discussion?
I'm sorry.
Supervisor Che.
So.
Great.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I've spoken with my school board representative from Bad Creek regarding this matter.
And I ask him what he would rather see as a school board member.
And I can't speak for the rest of the school board members, other than my own.
However, his input and thought was he would rather go into the school year knowing what money he may have to cut
rather than get halfway through a year and then have to cut two or three million dollars on programs they've already started.
I think it's only wise that we give direction to our staff on what their budget is likely to look at.
I think if you go to cut a 25% cut halfway through the year, hurts far greater and has more impacts on staff than a 25% in cut impact does now.
Because you would be cutting a greater amount of money over a shorter period of time for the when the cut is put in place.
I think it is prudent that we move forward with what Supervisor Dunn has presented simply because it's not totally taken off of the table.
But it is simply in a holding pattern until we see what money comes in.
It's a simple thing that I was told at five years old don't spend money that you don't have.
Thank you very much.
Professor Dunn.
The reason I think that this needs to be done now, you know, address the comments that Mr. Wells did was that in July, we have to make a commitment to the schools and right now the split is 57 to 43.
So if the schools get that money, we can't come back to them three, four, five months from now and say schools, please give us back.
So right now the withholding would be approximately $2 million in the county side.
The administrators already made such a withholding of about 2.8 million.
I heard nothing from the school side.
So if we go and pass this, if we do not pass this, then the schools get the money and if we do not give the revenue, then the board and the county is holding the differential.
So for that reason, my thought process was to withhold until we knew that we would have the money.
And when we know we have the money, we can go and appropriate, but if we do not get the money, then not only this board, but I would say the schools are also going to have to make some adjustments, especially in the fact that you have taxpayers, some of whom are out of work, you just a month ago were paying real estate taxes.
And so I think it's just a situation where we work together with the school board.
And they're willing to give us back the money. But right now, if we give it to them, it's thirst.
So that's my thought process behind doing it now versus doing it at a future point in time.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir.
Further discussion, anyone?
The motion is to delay disbursement of $4.8 million until the board decides to release it.
Are we ready?
Supervisor Fisher.
No.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Yes.
Supervisor Slaughter.
No.
Supervisor Wells.
Oh.
Supervisor Dun.
Aye.
Supervisor Graeber.
Aye.
Thank you.
Chair votes no.
Motion fails.
All right.
Committee business, Shawnee land sanitary district budget for fiscal year 2021.
It's chairman.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I missed 8c.
Thank you.
Supervisor Dun.
Mr. Chairman.
I submitted a motion to have a joint meeting with the school board discuss areas of mutual interest.
From my perspective, we have a growing community.
This community has grown 30,000 people 50% since the year 2000.
The schools have said that we have additional needs and expenditures.
And we have additional costs associated with that.
The purpose for the meeting would be to go and have a discussion.
The seven board members with the seven school board members in a face-to-face conversation.
For a couple of hours to walk through what our concerns are, how we meet them, et cetera.
This would be a work session.
People can be talkies candidly as they want.
There's going to be no votes.
Give us an opportunity just to convey that.
I'd like to see if this could occur in July or August or early September.
Whatever works out for people with schedules.
I know people have take vacations in July and August.
So I'm looking for something that would be convenient for all parties.
I think it's really important before we begin the budget session just to last some concerns.
A month ago, I laid out in our budget situation some thoughts and proposals.
I'd like to share those with the school board.
I'd like to get feedback from all of you as well as from the school board.
And to hear what the school board's perspective has been as well.
I've attended two September, October school board sessions.
But as an observer, I can't speak.
This will give us an opportunity to talk, to interact.
It will be helpful.
So if there's a consensus, I'd like to see if there's a agreement to do that.
If there's not a consensus, then I'm going to make a motion to do that.
Make a motion or you're just looking for the...
I believe it's all underway.
I believe staff is developing potential dates to bring back to us.
I don't...
I'm just asking your preference.
I mean, I'm impartial on...
I just want to get a joint meeting between our board and the school board.
How we get there is immaterial to me.
Mr. Chairman.
I believe I heard a motion.
I'm going to second Blaine's Supervisor Don's motion.
I'd like for him to restate it for the record.
Okay.
So Ms. Phillips can have it accurately, please.
Just the simple...
Move to...
I move...
Schedule a joint workshop.
I move the board of supervisors in the school board.
Well, a joint work session meeting in July, August or early September 2002
to work on areas of mutual interest.
Okay.
And...
I'll second that.
Okay.
Is there any discussion?
The only thing I would say we're sending out an invitation to the school board
to meet with the board of supervisors.
Yes.
So...
We're asking the...
We're asking the vote on.
It doesn't mean it's going to happen.
Okay.
This is an invitation.
This is an invitation.
This is an invitation.
Okay.
To the motion, please.
To the discussion.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor Graben.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I have had dialogue on May 27th.
I met with Chairman of the schools, which is Mr. Foreman, as well as my representative from Back Creek, Mr. Monk.
We had very constructive conversation.
What I have found is there have been something in school administration who have made promises to this board
and yet have not followed through on them.
One of those promises have been a line item budget after they received the money.
The funding for the fiscal year.
They have received the money, as far as received the budget, what they will be getting the allotment numbers from us.
And yet has still failed to produce a line item budget so that we can see where the money is proposed to be spent.
Both of the school board members that I spoke with spoke in favor of being open and transparent.
I believe part of that open and transparency includes being able to have good, hard questions asked back and forth from each board, as Supervisor Dunn has suggested.
And getting some answers directly from the folks who are in charge.
And I believe it would be a very productive meeting if we were able to do so.
Thank you.
Opponent that we can accomplish it.
So, any further discussion?
Anyone?
All those in favor, aye?
No.
We'll ask staff to contact the school system and continue work on a potential schedule.
All right.
That will bring us to the Shawnee Land Sanitary District budget for physical year 2021.
Mr. Chairman?
Yes, sir.
I would like to thank the community to attend all of the meetings at the Shawnee Land Meeting House with the residents there.
And there's been some very lively and good discussion.
A lot of what you're seeing in front of you is obviously the original proposal.
The reason it was the original proposal is because we were so late in the process there really be some difficulties in making much, many changes at the extent or timeframe which we were found to be looking at this budget here in May.
The advisory board has put measures in place in which they will be looking at this budget significantly sooner in the coming year.
And I believe we'll have a significant positive feedback from them moving forward.
So, I would like to make a motion to accept the proposed Shawnee Land budget as is presented.
Second.
And a second.
Is there any discussion?
Yes, sir.
We've received some comments from constituents in Shawnee Land that were concerned about the length of the process that they felt it was too short of a process in order to comment on this.
I would just point out that this is process has been going on now for the better part of a year.
The Public Works Committee, we've actually voted on this now three times, the same budget proposal three times in its past.
I think it's a very good proposal.
I think there's been plenty of open discussion about it.
I appreciate all the work that the Public Works Committee has done and I support the budget proposal.
Thank you, sir.
Any other discussion?
Yes, sir.
For legal purposes is the motion, a motion to approve the budget and to appropriate the funds.
Thank you, Mr Williams.
Yes, that is the motion.
I apologize.
Thank you.
I can concur.
I still concur.
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr Williams.
All right.
Any further discussion?
Supervisor Fisher.
Hi.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Flother.
All right.
Supervisor Wells.
Hi.
Supervisor Dyn.
Hi.
Supervisor Graver.
Hi.
Chair votes aye and the motion carries.
All right.
That will bring us to the public hearing ordinance regarding community continuity of operations
of Frederick County government.
Post extension of emergency ordinance we are not doing.
That is different though than the one we pulled off consent.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
This is ordinance change.
This is the one to allow county boards and commissions to conduct remote meetings through
I think it's October 22nd 7th.
I'm sorry.
I couldn't make that up.
The ordinance to permit committees board county boards and committees to allow remote participation
through I believe the date is October 27th.
Okay.
And we needed to.
It was promised on the COVID situation.
It's certainly obviously the board's prerogative whether it was just to continue this allowance.
And we're proposing to extend it to the end of the year.
October 27th.
October 27th.
I think that's the date that's in there.
October 27th.
October 7th.
October 7th actually.
October 7th.
My apologies.
The code limits it to six months.
Got it.
Okay.
All right.
So this is a public hearing.
Did anyone sign up?
Mr. Chairman.
Did we receive any comments?
No, sir.
All right.
Hearing that will close the public hearing portion of the discussion.
What do board like to handle this request?
Yes, sir.
I would move that we adopt the request.
Okay.
The motion is to approve.
Sir, second.
Okay.
And the second.
Is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman, rise McArthur.
It's a question for the county attorney.
Is this ordinance at all predicated on there being a state of emergency declared in the county in order for these provisions to apply?
It seems to me that there's language in the ordinance that states that discussions must be related to a state of emergency.
And some circumstances that there's less than a quorum available.
Does that...
That?
Well, there's two parts.
There's two parts to that.
One is it does contain a reference to the county's declaration of emergency.
It just simply says the county has declared.
The county did previously declare the board opted not to extend that tonight.
This board could certainly if it chose strike that language if it wants.
The allowance for participating in meetings to address the emergency is actually not a premise of...
Well, it's mentioned in this ordinance, but that allowance exists under state law regardless.
And that was really the ordinance's reference to it was to note that the ordinance does not affect a committee's ability to do so if they are addressing the emergency.
But we wouldn't have to have it declared emergency to predicate the ability to rely on this ordinance for having remote meetings and otherwise.
I don't think so.
I think that the board can certainly offer a viable explanation for this ordinance to address concerns individuals may have without the board having necessarily adopted a full scale emergency.
Thank you, Mr Williams.
Thank you, Chairman.
Further discussion, anyone?
Yes, Mr Chairman.
Yes, sir. So you're probably done.
Things I made this motion. I just want to clarify.
I thought process behind this.
I think that the governor's emergency declaration needs to end.
But for those people that are concerned, it allows those people on committees, on boards, on commissions that do have a concern to be able to participate remotely.
So that reason I made this motion so that those that have a concern are able to participate remotely, they will still have a vote without having to physically be there.
Further discussion, anyone?
All right.
Supervisor Graver.
Oh.
Supervisor Dun.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor McCart.
Aye.
Supervisor Fisher.
Aye.
So that's I in the motion carries.
We'll extend to October the 7th.
Okay, we have a public hearing ordinance amendments to the Frederick County.
I must apply.
Yes, good evening, Mr Chairman. Members of the board.
You all.
This should be relatively fresh in your minds.
This is a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance and the adopted development review fee schedule to reduce the fee for a conditional use permit for a commercial telecommunication facilities.
The purpose of this reduction in the fees is to encourage commercial telecommunication facilities to locate in those underserved areas of the county in particular rural areas west of interstate 81.
You all will also recall then in December of 2019, this board adopted the two track process for the review and approval of telecommunication facilities.
That includes a by-right tower up to 50 feet in height, which would be approved administratively by the planning and development staff and our standard process projects, which are for towers greater than 50 feet in height, which would continue to require a conditional use permit, subject to a public hearing by the planning commission of board of supervisors.
During that discussion, see P fees for these types of uses were identified as a potential barrier to service providers and individuals applying for a telecommunication facility permit.
The board at that time further directed staff to reevaluate the fees with the intention of reducing the fee to reduce that barrier to the application.
The Development Review and Regulations Committee, or DRRC, discussed this item on February 27, and at that time, staff made a proposal that for towers greater than 50 feet in height, $750 would be the fee, consistent with the other CP uses already listed in our development review fee schedule.
During their discussion, the Development Review and Regulations Committee recommended a tiered fee structure based on tower height, and that towers 50 feet in height are greater and less than 100 feet in height, $1,500 would be the fee, and for towers greater than 100 feet in height, $7,000, the current CUP fee remain in place.
Subsequent to that meeting at your March 25 meeting, the board adopted a temporary code amendment which expired on May the 24th, which have changed the conditional use permit application fee from $7,000, which is the current fee to $750.
The Planning Commission discussed the site on May 6, and did not make any specific changes to the proposed tiered fee schedule as proposed by the committee.
There was no consensus among the Planning Commission if it modified fee schedule with additional tiers differentiating between tower heights was an appropriate remedy, and the Planning Commission generally supported covering the costs or the real costs of an application to the county for processing and advertising CUPs for those types of facilities.
The board discussed the site on May 27th, and at that time the board recommended that a fee of $750 be advertised for the public hearing.
So the board stated at that time that the fee should cover only those costs associated with advertising, signage, and no to find adjacent property owners as part of the application.
The Planning Commission held a public hearing on June 3rd, where no public comment was received on this ordinance amendment.
The Planning Commission considered reconsider their tiered fee schedule, but they did not come to a consensus again, and the Planning Commission ultimately voted to recommend denial of the proposed $750 fee as advertised by the board of supervisors.
So following a public hearing this evening, staff is seeking a decision by the board of supervisors on this proposed ordinance amendment, and of course we are happy to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you.
Questions of Mr. Klein, anyone?
Mr. Klein, are there any identifiable or quantifiable costs to the county beyond the advertising and the notice provisions that we would typically assess as part of a CUP fee?
The $750 fee is consistent with what the cost to advertising is to the county.
Is there any direct correlation or any known correlation between the height of a tower and the cost associated to the county with regard to those things?
Not aware of such a correlation.
Thanks, sir.
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Tierney, sorry, I apologize.
I've been asked the question on decommissioning of those towers, and so from what I understand you can confirm that the tower goes up, the landowner who gets a CUP would be responsible, is that correct?
It would be responsible for the removal of that tower under the standard process projects.
Section 4, item C, that it states that any facility or structure permitted by the section that is not operated or used for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned in the owner of such a facility or structure shall remove that facility within 90 days of receipt of notice from the planning department.
If the facility is not removed within the 90 days period, the county may remove the facility and a lien would be placed on that property to recover those expenses to the county.
Therefore, Mr. Klein, if this were approved or any CUP were approved, it would be wise for the landowner to have a conversation with the people that put up the tower saying that at some point in the future there's going to be a cost.
And therefore, the landowner might want to say to the person putting up the tower makes certain that you have the money to pay me if that goes down.
But the same token, the person that puts up the tower, they want to go to an AT&T or Verizon, et cetera, to say if this tower comes down, you're profiting AT&T, you might have to do that.
So if they work together, when the tower first goes up, there'll be no cost to the taxpayer for the decommissioning.
Is that correct?
In theory, that's how it would work, yes.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Further questions, anyone?
Supervisor Slark.
Mr. Klein, if we had an instance like the tower that was being requested at Charando Park and the multiple advertising and so forth, that would come under a different process other than what you're recommending here.
Or would it be the same and would the $750 cover the cost?
So the fee for $750 covers the advertising for the public hearings for the Board and the Planning Commission.
If the applicant chooses to defer or delay a public hearing, or they make the request to the Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors, they cover the cost of re-advertising.
If, for example, the Planning Commission tables an item for 30 or 60 days to further consider it, and then we re-advertise, that cost would be burdened onto the county.
So it wouldn't necessarily be a correlation to the height of the tower.
If we're looking at a tower that'd say 199 feet, the cost you're saying the $750 would still cover the cost.
There's no correlation between costs and tower height as it, as our current advertising, our current review and processing and advertising is concerned.
Other questions, Mr. Klein, anyone?
All right, thank you, sir.
Is the public hearing, did anyone sign up?
No, Mr. Chairman.
And did we receive any comments?
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
We'll close the public hearing process.
How would the Board like to handle this?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I would move for approval of the minute ordinance for $750.
CUP fee for application for towers.
Motion to approve is our second.
Second.
And the second, is there any discussion?
Anyone?
Hearing none, supervisor Fisher?
I do have one question.
Is that up to 50 feet?
That's up to any height.
That's what I'm saying.
The way it's written.
That's correct.
Mr. Chairman, this is for over 50 feet.
The under 50 feet are covered by a separate section of the ordinance.
That's what I meant to say.
What a thought.
I just want to clarify that.
So we're talking 51 feet up or 50 feet.
One inch on up.
I'll vote that.
Okay.
Right.
So we'll go back.
We had a motion in a second.
And I believe discussion is over.
Finished?
Yes, what?
I was voting.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
I just wanted to ensure that we were there.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Wow.
Supervisor Wow.
Hi.
Supervisor Doc.
Supervisor Grave.
Hi.
Chair votes high in the motion carries.
That Mr. Klein will bring us to an ordinance amendment to chapter 165.
Conditional use permits.
This actually is for zoning enforcement violation penalties.
I'm sorry.
10 B.
Yes, sir.
Again, this is a zoning ordinance amendment to enact stricter penalties.
11 B.
This is an amendment to enact stricter penalties for zoning violations.
Okay.
omi.
The county enforces our zoning ordinance through the miseminar process.
But state law also would permit the use of civil penalties to remedy zoning violations.
If the county were to adopt civil penalties for specified violations,
state law would require the county pursuable penalties for those violations
up to an accumulated fine limit of $5,000 before pursuing
the violation through the misanminer process.
