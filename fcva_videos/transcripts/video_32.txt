We ask that you be with this board tonight, Lord, give them wisdom as they deliberate and work for the citizens of Frederick County, be with our first responders and keep them safe as they protect us.
Be with the military members, our veterans and their families continue to bless them and let them know that their service is very much appreciated as they take their time to protect us and protect the many freedoms that we enjoy.
And finally, Heavenly Father, we ask that you be with Supervisor Trout as she starts a new chapter in her life, Lord, watch over her and her family as they travel and keep them safe.
Call this gracious God. We pray in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen.
Mr. Chairman Lawton, you're leasing the pledge, please.
Would you stand face or flag and follow me in our pledge?
I pledge to thee, which is his flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic, which stands, one nation, one new God, individual, with liberty and justice for all.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
The adoption of the agenda, are there any proposed changes?
Staff has none, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir. How would the board like to handle the agenda?
Mr. Chairman, I move that we approve the agenda as presented.
Second.
Motion in a second. Is there a discussion?
Mr. Chairman, the provides are done.
On the consent agenda, on 6F.
We're not on consent yet.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
Adoption of the agenda.
In further comments, discussion?
All those in favor, aye.
Aye.
Opposed, no.
We'll adopt the agenda as presented.
Citizen comments.
Did anyone sign up?
Yes, sir. Sean Graver.
Mr. Graver.
Congratulations, by the way, sir.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, the board, thank you for the opportunity to address you this evening.
Sean Graver of the Back Creek District.
If I could, I'd like to call your attention under the consent agenda under 6F specifically.
I would urge you to take it off a consent agenda.
I would urge you to approve the $76,000, as I believe we may be in a time constraint there.
But I believe that staff needs to be directed to manage these items in a specific manner.
Most specifically, there needs to be a good working relationship with the Steven City Volunteer Fire and Rescue Company.
However, I do believe that the county must maintain ownership of that equipment, as well as make sure that the equipment is maintained.
The reason I bring this to you this evening, and I can't explain it in three minutes.
However, the county has given that department some money in the past and items have been purchased.
And the county career fire staff have not been able to access that equipment or utilize that equipment due to restrictions placed on them by the volunteer agency.
Well, there must be a good working relationship with the volunteer agency.
I believe that it is a mistake to give the highly technical equipment that this money would acquire to that agency without maintaining ownership by the county, as well as ensuring that that equipment is being maintained.
Please pull it off the agenda, have some discussion on it.
I strongly encourage you to approve the $76,000, but I also strongly encourage you to direct staff to maintain ownership and manage it through the Fire Rescue Department.
Thank you so much for your time.
Anyone else?
Shaniqua Williams.
Welcome.
Good evening, Chairman De Haven, and supervisors. My name is Shaniqua Williams, and I'm a resident of the Shawnee District.
We appreciate the call for an application process and finding a temporary replacement for Supervisor Trout.
In looking at all the applicants, we hope that you take into consideration that Supervisor Trout was chosen by the voters of the Shawnee District with the 62.9% of the vote against Challenger Kevin Callahan.
She has proven to be a good leader and elected official. She has inspired many of her constituents to be more involved in the local political process and engaged community as a strong community.
We hope that in your discussions, you will consider a replacement that will match her independent nature onto the special election next year.
Make your decision for this appointment.
Remember that the constituents of the Shawnee District have voted on who best represents the values of the area.
Supervisor Trout.
I thank you for your service to Shawnee and for having the courage to stand out and stand up for your constituents and to speak for us in many discussions that affect this entire county.
I thank you for always honoring what the community brought forth at these particular meetings.
I wish you well in your journey and your presence here will be missed.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
That's all.
Thank you, ma'am.
All right.
Consent agenda.
Would the board like to handle a consent agenda? Supervisor Dye.
I'd like to remove six F from consent, please.
All right.
We have a motion in a second to remove item six F from the consent agenda.
Is there any discussion? All those in favor? Aye.
Opposed now.
All right. Where shall we place it?
I would suggest you take it up.
Right after you approve the consent agenda would be my suggestion.
Okay. We can do that.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
So the consent agenda is adopted with the exception of item six F, which we will consider now.
Mr. Chairman.
We need a roll call vote on the consent agenda.
Yes, we do.
I'm sorry. I have it here.
Supervisor Trial.
Consent agenda with the exception of six F.
Aye.
The supervisor is done.
Aye.
The supervisor is locked in.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Aye.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
And we'll consider six F.
This is reading that discussion.
Mr. Chairman.
I'll give it a try.
In light of the comments that we just heard.
This grant, as I understand it, and cheap Linda Burgers here may need to bail me out.
But this is a reimbursement grant.
So funds flow through the county.
And I believe it would be our option that purchases made in relation to this grant could be subject to procurement and overseen by the county.
But I would want the chief to verify that.
So I think the concerns that were raised could be addressed in that fashion.
Thank you, sir.
Chief Linerberg.
Thank you, sir.
Did you mean to put you on the spot?
That's OK, Mr. Chair.
Mr. Wisdom, please.
Board members and Mr. Tarrini.
He's correct.
This grant is passed through money from the Virginia Department of Emergency Management.
It has very specific details on what can be procured.
I don't have that information with me at the moment, but it's equipment based on Stephen City Specialty's team.
There's a swift water team and also any assets could certainly be managed and maintained in inventory by the department.
If that's the pleasure of the board.
All right.
Thank you.
Would you be willing to answer questions?
Yes, sir.
Any questions?
Chief Linerberg.
Sir, is there a die?
Mr. Linerberg, based upon the previous comments, we would be able to get the money.
We would be able to make the control if we saw desires.
Is that correct?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sir, is there a loss?
Mr. Linerberg, I've generally a favor for getting the grant money when we can.
Sometimes free money comes with the strings.
Do you have any idea about any other ongoing cost that might be incurred by the county?
If, in fact, we take this grant?
Yes, sir.
Nice, sir.
Other questions of Chief Linerberg, anyone?
Seeing none, thank you, sir.
Appreciate all you do.
All right.
How would the board like to handle this one?
This is a requirement of law.
So the rest are done.
I'd make a motion that we accept the money with the caveat that we ask staff to be able to work in, but it's necessary so we may maintain control.
This would be a supplemental appropriation.
It's a reimbursable grant.
Is there a way that we can go and have that per Mr. Linerberg's comments to then to control and how that occurs?
You said except and what we have to do is appropriate the money because we put it up front.
We can appropriate.
Is that what you intended with your motion?
That was a question.
And the second.
Second.
The discussion.
Is there any?
So we need roll call.
It's money.
So we will go supervisor trial.
Aye.
Supervisor done.
Supervisor loft.
Aye.
Supervisor well.
Supervisor slaughter.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Care votes aye and the motion carries.
All right.
That will bring us to board a supervisor's comments.
Are there any anyone?
We'll move forward.
Mr. Chairman loft, would you assist me please with the bullies of the month?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.

Good.
Yeah.
Yes.
You could join us.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Great.

Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
All right.
We'll bring us to the committee appointments, economic development, authority.
How would the board like to handle this one?
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman.
I'll nominate Mr. Lauffman for the position.
All right.
I've heard the motion.
It's our second.
Our second.
And the second.
All right.
Any discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Although I think Mr. Lauffman would do an excellent job in this position, I think it would be in the best interest of the county if we had a member of the board serve on the EDA in this capacity.
Sorry, Gary.
Other discussion?
Anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Frazier, Karthi.
I think it is important to have a member of the board.
I agree with the supervisor.
It's important to have a member of the board on the committee.
I don't want to discount the fact that supervisor Lauffman is given quite a bit of time over the years in doing this.
I think he's been a valuable asset on the committee.
I would just point out we'll have another opportunity to appoint someone within 12 months.
So I think the decision tonight is either in my feeling would be either a point supervisor Lauffman tonight.
And then we can put a supervisor on next year.
Or if the board chooses to put a supervisor on tonight or choose to go with a supervisor that we very seriously consider putting supervisor Lauffman on when the next opportunity arises.
I think he's been a great asset.
I would ask that you also consider the continuity.
If we do consider putting him on, at some point there may be some prudence in keeping the continuity of keeping him in there.
But just food for thought as we consider this.
Further discussion?
Mr. Chairman, if I may.
Supervisor Lauff.
I understand the discussion has taken place here.
As you will remember the email I sent out that the reason I'm on the EDA is because I asked that the state allow a member of the board to serve on the EDA, which it could not do before.
The reason I did that is because I have been a member of the EDC and liaison to the IDA and a member of the EDA since its inception.
I wanted to continue to do that and realize without the ability of a board member to serve on the EDA, I would no longer be able to do that.
I have a real passion for promoting manufacturing industry and commercial and also workforce development within the county.
To continue that, to give an analogy, if we're saying we need a member of the board on this authority, then I would say we probably need a member of the board on Frederick Water Board because they both basically have the same type of duties, same type of responsibilities.
And so I understand why you might want to member the board on there, but also remember that we have an MOU that states that the Board of Supervisors and the EDA has a yearly meeting to discuss what the programs ought to be for the coming year.
And that the director of the EDA is actually the employee of the county.
So I think there's enough oversight there that my being appointed to the EDA would not have any detrimental effect at all and certainly would not diminish the role of the board on that board.
Further discussion, anyone?
The motion is in the second is to reappoint Supervisor Lofton, Supervisor McCarthy.
Aye. Supervisor Slotter.
I think we should have a board.
That's a no.
Supervisor Wells.
Oh. Supervisor Lofton.
Aye.
Yes, sir. Supervisor Don.
Supervisor Trial.
No.
Chair votes no.
Motion fails.
We're looking to appoint someone.
Mr. Chairman, I would make a motion to appoint Supervisor Slotter to fill the position.
Second, Mr. Chairman.
I'm sorry, Supervisor Slotter.
Second, Mr. Chairman.
She's second. Second.
Thank you.
All right. We have a motion to second to appoint Supervisor Slotter. Is there any discussion?
Anyone?
Supervisor McCarthy? Aye.
Supervisor Slotter.
Aye.
Supervisor Wells.
Supervisor Lofton.
No.
Supervisor Don.
Aye.
Supervisor Trial.
Aye.
Chair votes aye.
The motion carries.
Supervisor Slotter is appointed to the EDA.
Sony Lancaster, District Advisory Committee. Supervisor Lofton.
Do you want to talk to Tencent Center?
I'm sorry.
Oh, yes.
It is juvenile Tencent Center. I'm sorry.
I want to ask you something here.
Who's aá&%.
It's a, it's a time to reappoint our representative there.
We had appointed Robert Williamson,
because he's been there since the organization was created.
Represidents has done so with great dist突 and is eligible as well as j-tibs as alternate,
Mr. Williams, does it matter whether we do them together or separate?
They can be done together.
Together is okay.
Supervisor Wells.
I would move that we reappoint Robert Williamson to the juvenile detention center commission
along with Mr. J. Tibbs as alternate to the juvenile detention center commission.
All right, sir.
Is there any further discussion?
Is there a second?
Second.
And the second, is there any discussion?
Supervisor Trump?
Aye.
Supervisor Dyn?
Aye.
Supervisor Law?
Aye.
Supervisor Wells?
Aye.
Supervisor Slog?
Aye.
Supervisor McCartney?
Aye.
Chair votes aye.
The motion carries.
Thank you.
That will bring us to Shawnee Land Sanitary District Advisory Committee.
Supervisor Lofton?
Mr. Chairman, I am still seeking potential appointees for that position.
I want to look to talk to them and then I will be ready next month.
Thank you, sir.
Senator Erie, agency on aging.
Just for information, we are soliciting for applicants for that position.
I do think that we had one that hasn't made it act to the ward yet.
Is that accurate?
Not for that.
Maybe not.
Okay.
Well, we're certainly seeking folks who would be willing to serve as a representative to the
Shandall Area Agency on aging.
They do quite a lot of really important work in our community.
All right.
That will finish those up.
A quest for supplemental appropriation in 2013.
Mr. Chairman.
This one's a little unusual.
We brought it directly to the board because there was no finance committee meeting in November.
Some years ago, 2013, to be specific, the Shandall Valley Battlefield Foundation made a purchase of the Hunts Ferry Property,
which is part of a civil war battlefield.
They came to the county seeking assistance with the financing of that.
And at the time, the board made a commitment to provide $50,000 to retire the debt on that property.
The foundation has contacted us to indicate that they're now ready to do that in our requesting that we transfer that committed $50,000 to them.
So it would be a supplemental appropriation for that purpose.
All right.
We've heard the request.
I will add that those funds came from a dedicated proper or historic and recreational use.
So they were restricted funds.
I would the board like to handle this one.
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I think that we approve the couple of funds for the appreciation for the historic property of the property.
Thank you. So we've heard the motions are second.
Second.
Second.
Any discussion?
Supervisor Child.
Hi.
Supervisor Dyn.
Hi.
Supervisor Lofton.
Hi.
Supervisor Well.
Supervisor Slaughter.
I need to recuse myself.
I need to recuse myself from the vote, sir.
Yes.
And McCarthy.
Hi.
Thank you.
Chair votes aye.
And the motion carries.
All right.
I'm going to bring us to a resolution authorizing filing a petition of RIP.
Mr. Tierney or you, Mr. Williams?
I'm going to ask Mr. Williams to handle it.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The board has, of course, received Supervisor Trout's resignation, which is effective at the end of this meeting.
State code provides that the board shall file a petition with the circuit court within 15 days of the vacancy asking for the setting of a special election date.
State code provides that that date would be the November general election next.
So unless the board sets a different date consistent with the suggestion of the state code staff has prepared a proposed resolution for the special election to be conducted on November 3rd, 2020, which is the next November general election.
Thank you, sir.
You've heard the discussion.
How would the board like to handle this one?
Chairman.
Yes, sir.
I would move for approval of the resolution to authorizing the filing of a petition for a rate of special election to fill the Shawnee District Board of Supervisor Vacancy.
Thank you, sir.
You've heard the motion is our second.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Second.
Is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. President, are you done?
As you know, we've had two appointments in this situation in previous years.
I have advocated for a special election before November election.
If furthermore, as you know, there are certain time constraints, 60 days before and 60 days after general elections.
So to those that have said, you know, shadow trap was elected by Shawnee residents.
I think the Shawnee residents should have the opportunity to go and vote for replacement as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, by the constraints of the law, the earliest that can be done is in late August.
And we are having a general election in November.
So for those additional two months of September and October, the additional cost of over $10,000 to have that special election,
although I'd be in favor, I'm not going to advocate for that.
So I just want people that are listening to know that this special election is early to 10.
I would try to do it earlier.
Unfortunately, there's a Democratic election in March.
There's a Republican one in June, and that just prevents by law our opportunity to have something earlier.
Otherwise, I would advocate for, you know, March or April or January, but such a life self.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir.
It's further discussion, anyone?
All right.
It's motion to adopt the resolution or requesting the writ of election.
Supervisor Trout.
Aye.
Supervisor Dyn?
Aye.
Supervisor Lofton.
Supervisor Welles.
Yes.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Aye.
Chair votes aye and the motion carries.
I'm seated for interim appointment.
Mr. Chairman, in light of the action that you've just taken with Supervisor Trout's resignation,
the board has 45 days from the date that the position becomes vacant to appoint an interim member to fill that seat until the election,
based on past process, its staff suggestion that we advertise for the position.
We would do that through the county website, the Winchester Star, and receive applications with a letter of interest from those that may wish to fill the seat.
Leave that open.
We're suggesting until December 2nd, which would give us time, give the board time,
put that on your December agenda and select a candidate.
This is all, of course, up to the board.
The one hard date is that you have 45 days in which to appoint someone, or you sort of forego that right, and the court, fills the slot.
Thank you, sir.
Any questions, Mr. Tierney?
All right, so how would the board like to handle it?
We're looking to endorse the process so the staff can proceed.
Mr. Chairman, Supervisor Dott.
I'll make a motion that we go and follow Mr. Tierney's comments.
Have the county go and open a legacy notice if that's the appropriate term.
A legacy notice closed on December 2nd, report consideration on December 11th.
Yes.
Thank you.
Second.
So the motion is a second to adopt the process and approve the process that Mr. Tierney just described.
Is there any discussion?
Mr. Chairman.
Yes, sir.
One more comment.
We've had two other vacancies in the last three years I've been on the board.
And we've had multiple people that have gone and applied for these positions within the very few of them who've gone and decided to run in a general election.
I don't know who we're going to pick this time and nobody on this board does.
But if you're interested in this, irrespective of how this board votes, if you have an interest in this, then come next November.
Please consider running in a general election so that the people of Shawnee can go and make their own decision.
Don't be precluded by saying that the board just voted in favor of John Doe or Susie Smith.
John Doe or Susie Smith might be great people, but that's somebody else might be better.
So I'd really encourage candidates to have an interest in filling the Shawnee State to run irrespective of our appointment.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Further discussion, anyone?
Are we ready?
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Hi.
Supervisor Wells.
Hi.
Supervisor Loftin.
Supervisor Trout.
Hi.
Chair votes on motion carries.
Legislative agenda.
That will be me, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Tips.
The board has in her packet this evening, Mr. Chairman, a proposed 2020 legislative agenda.
Staff sought input from department heads as well as the board and has attempted to incorporate suggested additions that board members had.
As in past years, we've sort of broken the agenda down into two items.
The top part are the primary initiatives that the county supports.
And then the second half is sort of a list of other positions that the board has taken or will take relative to propose legislation.
This year we have identified eight primary initiatives that will be the focus of our lobbying efforts during the upcoming general assembly session.
And in the draft that's in your agenda packet, staff has highlighted the new verbiage.
Many of the items on the agenda are the same and have been the same for a number of years.
But for ease of reference, we have shown highlighted texts of new verbiage.
And also the input that we received from board members is shown in an italics underlying and also a highlight.
And I would point out that this is not the final agenda as bills are drafted and presented throughout the general assembly session.
We will continue to communicate our support or concerns on specific legislation to our state delegation.
And so what staff is seeking tonight would be boards, the boards endorsement of this proposed legislative agenda.
And then once approved, we will communicate those initiatives to our general assembly representatives.
Thanks. Questions of Mr. Titt, anyone?
The request is endorsement of the legislative agenda.
I do have one question.
With regard to item number 14 and that is legislative ordinance that would require a builder or developer of a residential house to complete the structure within one year.
The only question I have is that sometimes building takes longer than a year so I'm not sure how that legislation would work.
Mr. Chairman?
The supervisor has done.
I was the one that introduced that along with the comments and memo afterwards.
But basically the purpose for my introduction to this is in redbud, there are some houses that were beginning to be built.
The developer then went and moved his workforce, et cetera, elsewhere.
That was a completed basement.
You had construction site that was essentially abandoned and wasn't technically abandoned.
As long as the developer can go and do something within every six months and have something that could be simply as much as putting a bag of cement on the property.
It's considered to be under construction.
Residents that were in that area, I think rightfully so, were saying here you're beginning to build a house and it's essentially abandoned and you have a mess.
What I was saying within a year was to say that if a developer or builder begins to break ground or do anything, let them have a year to finish it.
If it takes longer than a year to build a residential house, then I'm open to suggestions and modifications.
If it's something that deals with a commercial entity, which may take longer in the year, I'm open to suggestions and modifications.
But in a current law right now, state law is impossible for an adjacent homeowner with a lot there to do anything about it.
That's what the purpose or the suggestion.
I'm also willing to work with a building community and the developers.
This was just to put out initially.
I'm open for a complete discussion on the pros and cons, what works, what doesn't work.
But we had to start someplace else.
Just starting here, open and subject to further discussions, but that's the reason behind it.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman.
Just to follow up on that comment, Mr. President, since this is sort of an idea and development, would you be okay with removing it for this year's legislative session so that this board can have more discussion and put something more succinct into this, since we are sort of all signing on to this as we're endorsing this as something we want to see.
Mr. McCarthy, I'd like to just include it with the verbal comments here as I'm chatting that I'm open for our discussion.
I'd like to start someplace and so you have to start someplace with a bill.
And from my perspective, I'll be glad to hear input from builders.
I'll be glad to hear input from developers.
I'll be glad to hear input from residents that are adjacent to those.
I'd like to include it so that it can be put up for discussion.
As you know, Mr. McCarthy, you have a bill that will then go to a committee and it may or may not come out of a committee.
So I'm looking to go and use this as a vehicle to start the discussion and see whether the discussion goes.
So just if I may.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
So just to follow up, so this is a very general, but very specific item one, this legislative agenda, so it's very general in that you sort of haven't fleshed out yet exactly how you think it should be worked out.
It's very specific with regard to the one-year timeline.
I know that in my business as a real estate attorney, there's quite often times that a residential property isn't completed within a year.
Would you be okay with rewarding this in some way to say that we address abandoned properties that aren't completed within a reasonable time versus a one-year timeframe.
That way those reasonable times can be fleshed out at the state level amongst the legislature.
I think that would be open to having a discussion says the time that is conducive to both the developer and the residential areas.
So if you want to remove the one-year, when you start to draft legislation, you're going to have to put some either wording in or number in there.
So for this to go forward, you're going to have to have something that's written and it's going to have specifics.
I'll help draft legislation with all parties concerned on behalf of the constituents that I have.
Mr. McCarty, if you want to go and thank the suggestion, I'm open to that for this purpose of discussion.
As we begin this process for the General Assembly, I'll come back with something that I think the builders would like, developers would like, and the adjacent homeowners would all consider to be fair.
Let's turn it off for an amendment to the motion.
Was the motion made yet or were we just in discussion at this point?
We had a motion to approve the legislative agenda.
You can amend.
I would make a motion to amend the motion to strike 14 until such time as we can come up with a better definition of what the solution would be.
Second, Mr. Chairman.
And a second to the proposed amendment to the motion.
We're now discussing the amended motion.
Mr. Chairman, to adopt the legislative agenda without 14.
Mr. Chairman, we don't have an original motion.
No, sir.
Mr. McCarty's motion would be the motion.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman, are we now in discussion of the amendment to adopt the legislative agenda without item 14?
So I'm wondering about this amendment.
And I wonder about the time frame when the legislative agenda will be presented to our legislators.
Is it possible to look at this again at our next month meeting to maybe address the verbage with reasonable versus a one-year time frame so that it accomplishes?
Our general goal is to get with those folks before they go to Richmond for the early session.
But I mean, we can always go back to them.
With an amendment at some point, as well.
I don't see why we couldn't do that.
Mr. McCarty, I'm not in favor of your motion without your respect.
It's a different way that people work out in the next month.
Some language that works to bring this back next month.
I'm open to that.
The general assembly will not begin until June, January, 3rd, 4th, and stuff like that.
There's items that are going to be before committees.
I'll be open to going, having discussion to put it on the agenda next month.
But if that's not comfortable, then I'll shoot for this.
So that's what I'd like to do.
Mr. Chairman, a question for Mr. Williams.
It's my understanding that proposal legislation should be offered by the legislators in early December.
So that the staff can be working on it and have it ready for when they come.
So I'm just wondering at that time frame of concerning this next month,
is that going to be too late for the rest of our agenda for this one item?
That's a good question.
I don't know what that specific deadline is, Mr. Hofton.
But I think you're, if not right, very close to right that I have a vague recollection that there is a deadline for them to get the ideas in for drafting.
I think it is early December, so the board's timetable may not align with that.
Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that if we know one through 13 is agreeable that we could vote on that.
And then if in the meantime, we can work on 14.
Supervisor, I'd be happy to work with you on that.
If we can come up with something, we can always submit it at a later date.
But I'd hate for us to put off 13 very important priority items in the hopes of getting 14 worked out in the meantime.
Great. Further discussion?
Yeah.
I agree with you on the one through 13, so we don't have a problem on that.
I'm open to wording that basically says for number 14 that some type of legislation that addresses properties that are not continuously worked on would be helpful.
I think that Mr. Williams is right that the December 11th might be a little bit later.
But if committees knew that an additional piece of legislation was going to come within a week, then I think the most delegates and senators would be open to that.
Mr. Chairman, I have since found that date.
It is December 5th is the deadline for General Assembly members to get the bills in.
Thank you.
That's helpful.
All right. Is there any further discussion?
All right.
The motion is to forward the legislative agenda without item 14.
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Hi.
Supervisor Wells.
Hi.
Supervisor Lofton.
Hi.
Supervisor Trout.
Hi.
Chair votes aye.
Motion carries.
We'll adopt the legislative agenda and we will continue discussions on item 14.
Committee business.
Public Works Committee.
Auburn Convenience Center.
How's that one?
Mr. Chairman, you skipped the-
I'm safe to you.
I skipped the radio.
I'm sorry.
I did.
I was drawing down the margin.
Public safety radio.
Who has that one?
That's me again, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Board, my recall on June 12th there was a work session held with mission critical partners
to hear the findings of their public radio system technical assessment report.
The board received the report which provided an overview of the current radio system.
A recommended level of coverage or performance standard.
A recommended system design and an estimated cost to implement.
Following the work session with MCP and an opportunity for the board to digest the study,
there were some questions raised regarding the possible use of West Virginia's statewide interoperability radio network.
Also known as siren as an alternative to constructing a new radio system.
So to answer those questions that were raised and to explore the viability of siren as an alternative,
MCP was again retained to analyze siren as an option.
The scope to work in their proposal included whether siren could meet the desire technical and performance requirements,
any potential cost savings, and various business factors such as a willingness of siren administrators to consider
a business relationship with Frederick County, an initial and ongoing cost procurement considerations,
governance requirements, and requirements in guidelines regarding participation, use, maintenance, and future upgrades of the system.
MCP completed their analysis and last week they presented a draft report to representatives of the users of the system,
those being the fire rescue department, the sheriff's department, emergency communications, and representatives of the volunteer companies.
This group is known internally as the communications committee.
At the conclusion of that presentation, the communications committee forwarded the report to the board
and recommended that the board authorize the development of a request for proposals which would enable actual costs to be determined and presented to the board at a later date.
Mr. Mike Miles was with MCP is here tonight to present his analysis to the board.
And at the conclusion of MCP's presentation, staff would be seeking authorization from the board to develop system specifications and an RFP document,
and move forward with a competitive procurement process that will result in a selected vendor, the system solution of choice, and a negotiated contract for the board's consideration.
So with that, Mr. Chairman, I'll turn it over to Mr. Miles to do the presentation for the board.
Thank you, sir.
Welcome, sir. I appreciate you being with us.
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Mr. Tibbs.
It's been about six months since I've been before you. I think almost everyone was here last time.
There may have been one or two absences.
Briefly, my background is in law enforcement.
I was an elected county sheriff in Wisconsin for three terms.
And then most recently, I've been doing public safety consulting for a while with mission critical partners.
And so I'd like to start with a quick review of that radio assessment findings because it has been about six months.
And we really had that in a work session previously as opposed to an action item for you.
And then talk a little bit about the Siren option analysis, and then go over the recommendations.
So we completed the radio system needs assessment.
You may recall that there was a report completed, which you all received, I think, both in hard copy.
It's certainly electronically a 50 plus page report that was pretty thorough, I believe, in talking about the current needs.
And where the county wanted to go to provide a better quality public safety radio system for the users.
We had the workshop presentation that was really informational at the time.
And then since then, we're requested to do this more detailed analysis of the Siren option.
We worked very collaboratively with county administration, Mr. Tibz and I spoke regularly and reviewed the information as that analysis was completed.
So very briefly, the current system, the biggest problem is insufficient coverage.
This is especially important for the law enforcement side of the system.
Fire and law enforcement are slightly different.
If you recall, the law enforcement system is really very deficient in the amount of reliable coverage that it provides to the people who are trying to use it in the county.
But we also have issues with capacity and redundancy and reliability.
There are several sort of weak links in the chain that if you have an outage, it can cause a serious impact on the system that you have.
So all those things would be addressed in a new system.
Basically, what you have, and if you recall, on a day-to-day basis, certainly on a weekly basis, people who use this system are unable to make certain calls reliably.
And we came to you with a whole list of examples that Ms. Piles had been compiling that showed actual complaints in the nature of them.
And so I just wanted to reinforce with you that this isn't in a situation where occasionally it doesn't work just perfect on a regular basis.
There are problems with people who are trying to use the system for reliable communications.
And as you can imagine, the people who are doing that are in the public safety community.
And although many of their conversations are routine, there's a small subset that are not routine.
And they're a very urgent of nature. And if that's one of the calls that doesn't work well, you're in a bad place.
And so the users at that time, and what we communicated to you is that they are really looking for a long-term solution.
Their preference is not to try to put a couple of band-aids on this, but to come up with a long-term solution.
And it's our judgment that the only way you're going to see significant improvements here is in investing in a new system.
And you can't really fix what you have. It has to be replaced.
So then we looked at the SIREN option because there's a lot of conversation about the potential merits of that.
And Mr. Tibbs explained in his memo the different factors that we looked at in the interest of time.
I'm not going to go through each one for you, but I'll hit the highlights.
We did with an initial conversation. It was a good conversation back and forth with the SIREN folks.
I had a conference call with key individuals, including the Director of Homeland Security for the State of West Virginia.
He was very accommodating, and he directed his staff to work with us diligently, and they did.
We exchanged several documents, several emails, and Mr. Tibbs and I were looking for clarity.
To make sure we understood what they were offering and what they were not offering.
Any partnership needs to be mutually beneficial, and that's what we were looking to see.
And so in the end, the issue that seemed to have the most potential would be if this sort of relationship would save you significant money.
Really, we found that they offer by SIREN to share the core, and the core is a term Motorola uses, in essence, as a proprietary solution,
because SIREN said, if we are to do this, if you are to build your system, and then we adopt it and make it a part of our system,
it has to be consistent with our system. And so you would have to be provided by Motorola because that's who provided their system.
And that's what that network would have to be provided by Aviat.
So there are other ramifications to that quasi-soul source sort of a procurement.
But when they share their core, and the core in Motorola's speak is sort of the hub, technical hub of sorts of the new system,
it assigns resources, and it manages all the databases. They're very complicated databases here.
The SIREN's is in the center of West Virginia, and we would connect to it via microwave.
There's ours connecting to theirs, and that's how that would work.
If you would lose that microwave, and the savings would be about $300,000, if you didn't have to buy your own core, which typically you would do.
Other manufacturers call it something else. Everybody has a brain to the system.
And that would be diminished by having to provide microwave links for SIREN because one of their prime interests in this partnership is they want to develop a microwave loop in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia.
And they would hope to tie into some of your new sites or existing sites, create a couple of new microwave connections, and make their microwave more resilient in Eastern Panhandle of the state.
To do that, our cost, we believe Frederick County's cost to do that would be about $100,000.
And then there would be another solution that we would strongly recommend you use, and that would be what Motorola calls edge.
Briefly what that does is if you lose that microwave link back to the center of West Virginia instead of being orphaned and losing a lot of the capabilities,
which allows the system to pick up most of the functionality that you would lose until you could repair the microwave or whatever the case would be.
And so those two things, the cost they had the microwave and the cost they had edge, reduce the $300,000 savings potentially to the $150,000 range.
As you know, we're talking about probably a $15 to $20 million system.
So in my judgment, a rather modest savings.
The larger concerns with SIREN is that the impact to the competitive procurement environment, because SIREN is going to require you to use Motorola and use Aviat for microwave.
So there is, there would not, arguably there's not a competitive environment to negotiate with, to get competing proposals.
And in our judgment, in each and every time we've seen a competitive process versus a regular process, the best pricing always comes out of the competitive process.
Even in a case where maybe you'd only get one bidder, because we don't know, we'd like to establish a process where you'd get two or three bidders, but you don't know how that's going to go.
Even if in the case where you would just get one bidder, I have always seen the pricing from that one bidder be better if they thought it was a competitive process, and they didn't know if others were going to be presenting proposals or not.
And so, arguably with the small amount of savings and the negative impact of a non-competitive process, it could actually cost you more to go that route than less.
And Mr. Tips may want to speak to this, but I know he had at least some conversation with county procurement and county attorney, and there's some concern that this could be justified as a sole source procurement.
So, that's a variable. And then lastly, because they want it to be consistent with their system, and their system is UHF, they said that our system would have to be UHF.
We're not opposed to that. We just think it's going to be very challenging to get enough frequencies to license for a countywide symbol cast design.
It's not impossible, but in our judgment, that would be very challenging. And so, you could be in a situation where if you wanted to go down this path, you'd get so far and find out you couldn't get enough frequencies, and now what do you do?
So, you have to have enough frequencies, or you have to compromise your design and do something that would require less frequencies.
Again, I'm not saying it's impossible, but in our judgment, it's a challenge to find enough UHF frequencies, especially for a countywide system that's symbol cast.
Okay. This is another bit of a history lesson. It's hard to see, but the orange and the yellow are good, reliable coverage.
I remember the committee that put together the requirements or the desired level of performance for the new system said, we'd like to have really good coverage along the I-81 corridor around Rincchester, and within a couple of miles of Winchester, because that's where most of the population is, most of the activity is, it would be good countywide coverage everywhere.
But this is what law enforcement has today. If you put that model on top of the way the current system is performing, and you looked at that and said, well, now that's not very good at all, you're exactly right. It's not.
Okay. And then the way to fix that is to add more sites and add more radio signal and add more coverage.
And so our technical staff went through and said, they think about eight sites will do it. Doesn't mean it won't end up being seven. Doesn't mean it won't end up being nine.
But I've never seen it be far from the judgment of our technical experts. They have some very extensive software that they use and a lot of expertise in that.
But each manufacturer does a little differently. At any rate, eight sites and a bunch of new radios, and that's the primary thing that drives your cost.
Those are the cost factors, the design, the implementation, putting the sites in, buying the radios.
So that's why there isn't a significant cost difference because essentially you're going to have to build the system you need anyway.
If you went with Siren, you'd build it, and then it would become part of the Siren system, but you're going to pay for it, you're going to build it to meet your needs.
Okay.
If it was the pleasure of the group who would be working on the RFP, we could include an option for a vendor to propose some sort of a partnership with Siren.
It would really be just one vendor that could do that. It would be Motorola because of stipulation from Siren that it has to be a Motorola solution.
But you could say every vendor has to give us a proposal for our core requirement, our system.
However, if you'd like to give us an optional proposal to do something with Siren as a partnership, they would have that opportunity.
But only after they responded to the primary proposal. So that way, everybody would feel it was still a level playing field, and each of the primary vendors who might have an interest would feel that they're being treated equally.
Yet Motorola, if they chose to, could say, oh, maybe they could develop a proposal that they thought was mutually advantageous as an option. So I just wanted to point that out.
This would be the improvement in coverage. We believe you'd get from an eight-site system. So remember, if we go back here, there's not very much orange.
And there's certainly not very much orange or yellow, where you'd really like to have your best coverage and look at the improvement. So it's significant.
And it will be a very noticeable significant difference in performance when you get to that point. And oddly enough, and Jay, you and I didn't have a chance to talk about it.
But at the committee meeting, there was a question from the Sheriff's Department. They said, gee, we wish it looked a little bit better down here.
And I'm also helping Shenandoah County build their new radio system on the project manager for that. We just had some meetings down there earlier today.
They're building a site right about there. It's going to be the cotton town site. And Gary, you who was the retired chief from Fire Rescue down there, he's now the part-time project manager.
And he said, I'd love to give Frederick County the opportunity to be on that site. And we both think that they would actually fill down there. So I just mentioned it because it would be an opportunity to work, I think, with the next county over who I know has a willingness to do that for you.
I still have to buy equipment for it, but you would save the cost of constructing the site because they're already doing that for their needs.
And so very briefly, the new design would address the countywide coverage issues that we've talked about through the building of approximately eight sites.
You might be able to reuse some of your current sites that we'd encourage vendors to look at those. But in the end, the vendor should select their design because they have to stand behind it.
It would enhance interoperability both within the county and with other agencies. It would improve capacity and flexibility that you'd get from the trunking architecture and the additional channels.
If we explain to you, you've got a kind of an old school conventional system now. And this would be a trunked cymbal cast system. It's a huge leap ahead forward in technology.
It would be much more reliable because of the way the microwave system would be designed and the other inherent reliability in the new technologies. There really aren't any single weak links anymore.
It's made to be very resilient. You can have a small outage here and there and it just keeps going and you don't even realize that it's there.
Improved security features, improved technical capabilities. You could have some data functions on it like GPS location and over the air programming, which down the road means as you reprogram radius.
To bring everyone to a technician and actually just upload sort of like when you download an app on your phone over the air on the radio system that can save a lot of money in the long term if you're thinking over five or 10 or 15 years, how many times you might reprogram the radios.
And it would be built on a flexible standards based architecture with an extended life. And so hopefully this is a purchase you would make that you would get many years of service out of.
The estimated costs I pulled in the report a few things from from the prior study. We were talking about approximately 15 million for the infrastructure and radios and approximately five million for all of the potential options for a total of about 20 million dollars.
We believe a competitive process will result in a lower number than that. And also since this was completed, the school district came back and they rethought how many radios they had initially said they would need and they reduced that number significantly.
It's not something I think is finalized exactly yet, but that significant reduction would probably be a million or a million and a half dollars in savings in the overall project.
So it's not a small reduction if in fact they do stand by their much reduced number. It would probably bring, you know, say a million or a million and a half dollars so that that was good news.
And so we're before you tonight and as Mr. Tips explained, wanted to explain the site run analysis to you and look for your endorsement to move forward with the next phase.
Which is develop an RFP and then go through the procurement process. So put the RFP out on the street. I have a selection committee. Select the best proposal and vendor. Sit down and negotiate a contract with that vendor. Ultimately being able to come back to the board maybe five to six months from now and say in the judgment of the committee.
Here's the best proposal after negotiations. We think this is a fair and reasonable price and then bring it back to you for a decision to proceed and fund the project.
I know Supervisor Wells, Supervisor Slaughter attended a good portion or almost all of the committee meeting. And so you have maybe a little bit of a head start and some of the details and had a chance to answer and ask a few questions.
But that's where we're at and a reminder that it's going to be two to three years, or as Mr. Wells says, it's almost a little, almost always a little longer than you think, just like building a house, right?
So two to three years from you saying, you know, okay, let's move forward to when you'd ultimately be able to commission the new system.
And as you know, the needs they're already. So the people who are waiting for the big improvements are going to think, you know, gosh, I wish it could happen faster. But the reality is that's about how long it takes and the long pull and the tent is the site development piece when you're adding new sites and finding land and building some of these sites. It just, it takes a while.
So what questions may I answer for you?
Questions from the ward. Anyone?
Roger died.
If I've heard you correctly, sir, you're making a proposal for a 700 800 megahertz system and looking for a vendor that will go and implement that. Is that correct?
In our judgment, the available frequencies are probably, we know that they're in 700. There are 700 frequencies that are available.
We are not opposed. And I, the people who I have worked with on county staff are not opposed to having it be an 800 system or having it be a UHF system, but we're being a little pragmatic in that we think it's going to end up being 700 because of what we know about frequency availability.
And what we have seen any system that meets your performance requirements will be fine.
So if a vendor comes in and says, I think I can do it with UHF and we audit that and we think it's viable.
That could be an okay solution to answer your question.
Let me ask with a little bit differently. If you're going to ask us to go and do a vote today to go forward.
I read this this afternoon. I'm aware of, I read the 50 page report that we had earlier.
Are we just voting for a proposal that says we have a problem as you've described, solve it, or are we having a voting for a proposal that has a set of parameters?
Because if it has a set of parameters, I'd almost like Mr. Chairman to defer this for a month so I can just go back and talk to staff and see what their input is pro and con on this.
And RFP will have a set of specifications and performance parameters. So it has both in there that if you build a site, it has to have this kind of a generator.
It has to have these other things. And the key to the performance is here's the coverage levels we want in the county.
We would not say you have to build a 700 system or an 800 system or a UHF system. We want a system that meets these performance characteristics.
We think it's going to end up 700, but the vendors will look at that and the RFP will not say it has to be any particular frequency.
Other than if we decide to include the option for siren, then there's a stipulation from siren that it would have to be UHF for that option.
So it would still be up to the vendors to have to figure out do we think we can find enough usable frequencies that are licenseable to make our design work.
So your president, once you might want to consider, is a pause at a point in the process. Maybe once you've had RFP responses, pause and evaluate those from your recommendation of your review of those.
So let me explain the nature of the next phase. You'd meet with the committee and verify that these are the requirements that you want to see in the RFP.
Then we'd produce the RFP. We'd provide a copy to the committee to make sure it was in alignment with the discussions that we had.
The proposal would go out on the street and vendors would have a certain amount of time to respond.
After the proposal is out on the street for a couple of weeks, you usually have a mandatory pre-bid and you bring the vendors in on-site.
You let them go to the sites, you answer their questions and give them an opportunity to ask for clarifications.
They're usually our series of questions. They ask them a week or two later, you respond and then they provide their proposals and you usually want to give them at least eight weeks from this time it goes on the street until you get their proposals.
They'd like more time than that, probably somewhere between the eight and 12 weeks is what you want to give them to do that.
Now you get the proposals back and we evaluate them as a committee. You have criteria that you measure against.
MCP would take a look at those proposals and make observations and comments which we would review with the committee.
We would work with the committee to help build consensus about how they score.
The whole idea is to not only make the best selection but have a process that can withstand any challenges.
A losing vendor may come back and say, wait a minute, it was an unfair process and you want to be able to go back and say, well, here was our process.
We think it was fair and reasonable so that the challenge wouldn't be upheld.
So now you select vendor X because the committee said we think this is the best proposal and the way ideally if you have multiple vendors is we're going to talk to you vendor X first because we think you have the best proposal.
However, understand that arguably if you had two or three and the others were okay also it's just most judged the best.
You could go back to number two if your negotiations failed with number one. It gives you some additional leverage.
So then generally at least three negotiation sessions with the vendor and I can't emphasize enough the importance of detailed thorough negotiations so that they understand what you want.
You understand what you're getting and there's clarity around the budget and the budget contingency is sufficient because I know you all don't want us to say the project is going to cost X and then later on come back with a couple million dollars of change orders for you that we didn't anticipate in the regional budget.
So we work very diligently to have both a budget and a budget contingency that are reasonable and they'll get the project done.
So then after all that we'd come back to the board and say okay select the committee selected vendor X we'd explain the process to you and say and here is a negotiated contract offer to proceed.
And then you'd have a selected vendor you'd have a contract in front of you you'd have a dollar and cents amount you'd have a contingency budget and you'd make the decision on if you wanted to proceed and how you'd fund it.
You addressed my concern I thought and that was that you were bringing the specifications back to the committee for review and confirmation and you were going to do the same thing with the RFP responses.
Absolutely it's a very collaborative point when you've analyzed the responses you'll be back to the committee through the committee to the board.
Absolutely that that addresses my concern I don't know if I supervised or not.
So Mr. Chairman you have the floor.
You've been on this communications committee more than I have so you have a lot more information on input.
My only question to you sir is if we vote in favor of this as opposed to postponing this for months so I can have a conversation with staff.
Is there anything that is being restricted for example that's the absurd okay if somebody said we can do a proposal which 200 megahertz works fine.
And then is that automatically precluded by what we've done here or if something outside what your parameters are works is that part of the consideration.
So I don't want to pre today I'm open to having a discussion and a vote for allowing you to go forward to saying fine what's the best option to solve the problem.
I don't have something restricted I don't want to be surprised by a restriction that says well here was a solution that could have worked but because of your vote Mr. Dunn it can't be considered.
So I want to make certain that if we go forward with an RFP all options are on the table.
I have an opportunity to talk to you know the sheriff's office I have an opportunity to talk to fire and rescue see what their input is and their thoughts are as well.
Sure.
So let me try to address your concerns.
First of all staff and the agencies have already been involved in several meetings where we've spent hours talking about the criteria and developing the criteria.
And certainly Mr. Tips has been very involved in this so from the standpoint have staff been engaged.
But in the next phase they will continue to be engaged at an even higher level.
We write a RFP and specifications where they have to respond to that primary proposal but we're not telling them how to do it.
We're not saying you need to propose an eight site system we're saying here's the system performance criteria.
During the pre-bid we may say and this is all public record anyway these reports and things like that so they can read the report.
They can see that we said anything is going to be about eight sites but we don't know for sure it's going to be up to them.
I have occasionally seen a vendor come back with a creative option when that happens we take a look at it and we look at the merits of it.
I've seen normally if there's multiple vendors normally the proposals aren't way different as far as a design.
Sometimes the pricing is way different but the designs are usually similar.
On rare occasion you'll have a couple of vendors come in and say well we think you need eight sites and this vendor says well we think you need 17.
We're going to have a raised eyebrow on that one and say well either one is one is right and two are wrong what's going on here and then we have our baseline.
So we don't prohibit creative thinking but we give it a sanity check and part of the process then in reviewing is okay this one's a little different let's help us understand how it's different and do we think that it has merit or not.
One other thing that you do later on is oftentimes have vendor orals and so that's an optional thing but a lot of times they do it where okay they've gotten their proposals.
We've rated them on paper and now we would invite the vendors in to help explain their proposals and as part of that we would have a list of questions and a format we want them to cover.
So okay we've looked at your proposal we have some questions we'd like some clarifications come in and give a presentation and so again it's a multi-step process and very collaborative.
So if the communications committee had said we'd like to have the coverage for let's say 95% of the county or 98% of the county or whatever criteria that communications committee said then this bill today would just simply ask for a vendor to try to provide a means to achieve that is that correct.
Yes essentially you're saying here's how it has to work and it's up to them to present a design as to how it works and then they will guarantee that performance level and you'll test to it.
Thank you Mr. Chairman.
Yes.
Further? Anyone?
Other questions?
No just a couple comments the idea that the committee will be involved in the process of developing the RFP just to reiterate and that once the RFP is developed
then it will go back to the committee.
The committee will make sure that it has checked all the boxes that they wish to see with this radio system.
That is a part of this overall process.
Yes.
Okay.
Other questions?
Here your company as we discussed it all means you're going to be writing this RFP.
Yes sir putting that together to present to us.
Yes sir.
And that comes with a cost?
Of course.
Yes sir.
Do you want this hold?
Is that a fixed cost that we have at this point?
I've given Mr. Tibb's a budgetary estimate on that and a detail of the various steps a lot of which we just talked through that would be there.
And there's a lot of meetings involved in this probably at least seven or eight times that we're going to be on site meeting with the committee meeting with vendors and doing different things.
And so we would turn that at the administration's pleasure into a letter proposal and give it a little bit more detail but I believe you have a fairly good understanding of what that would look like and we've had a conversation about if that would align with your needs or not.
Is your question?
No.
Is it a fixed cost?
It will be.
It will be.
It's been determined at this point.
Right.
I've given a budgetary estimate.
I don't see that this is going to be any higher than that preliminary steps.
And given that will be a guarantee maximum nothing.
Yes for the next phase of work.
Yes sir.
Okay.
The only other comment I have is that we really need the system.
The supervisor's lawyer and I've been involved in this process for quite some time.
And I just know the needs.
We have one other part.
It doesn't affect you.
But there's one other part while we're doing this over this three year period.
We still have to operate.
And I know our responders now have radios that are not working.
We're spending a lot of money on repair.
So the board needs to not only look at this but in the future we start.
We need to look what we do during this period while we're putting the system together.
Yes sir.
I don't want that to get lost in this process.
Yeah.
We have some.
We have some.
We have some.
We have some ongoing needs over the next two or three years to replace some radios and do a few things to.
Keep being able to operate on the system you have today.
Yep.
Thank you.
Mr. Chairman.
One last comment.
One of the options was in the development of the RFP that if the committee so chooses that they could go back and include the siren system as a part of this RFP.
Correct.
As an option.
So the vendors again would have to respond.
We should leave that door open.
I have no objection to it.
I didn't want to presume that that's what the committee wanted to do but that's certainly something that we can incorporate into that.
All right.
Further discussion?
Further questions?
Anyone?
Thank you very much.
Appreciate all your work.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
How would the board like to handle this one?
Mr. Chairman.
I would like to make a motion that we move the public radio system.
Technical assistance to the RFP process.
Engaging the communications committee in the initial design of the RFP and components and then also to have further review of the development.
Once it is developed to make sure that it does check all the boxes.
Any other motion?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Sir, second.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Second.
Discussion.
Supervisor Lofton?
No.
Okay.
Anyone?
Mr. Chairman.
So it's a supervisor's letter.
That would include at least the consideration of the siren that has not been ruled out nor has it been ruled in.
But it's on the table.
It's a consideration to see if that works in conjunction with federal accounting.
Thank you.
All right.
Any other discussion?
Supervisor Trout.
Aye.
Supervisor Don?
Aye.
Supervisor Lofton?
Aye.
Supervisor Welles?
Aye.
Supervisor Slotter?
Aye.
Supervisor McCarthy?
Aye.
Chair about time and motion carries.
All right.
Who brings us to the Public Works Committee?
Who has that one?
Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor McCarthy?
Go ahead.
Background.
You guys work it out.
Let me know.
Point that each other.
I'll try and start.
As I think everyone's aware, we have been working with the school system for quite some time now to try and.
Design and get in place.
What's needed to build a replacement.
Convenient site.
We've got the easement.
We have a site plan that's been developed.
And we're now ready to go finally with the construction of that all the convenient site.
The estimate is 1.6 million.
You're bringing it to the board.
Again, because there's not going to be a finance committee meeting this month.
And I know Public Works is anxious to move forward.
So we're looking for authorization to proceed with the construction.
And it's our thought that we would take the 1.6 out of our capital fund.
So we're looking to the board for your approval on that proposal.
If you want to see a while, there's a hear if there's detailed questions and supervisor.
Let's see.
Do you have anything you'd like to add?
I would just add that Auburn is our busiest site in the county.
Yes.
It's the most congested site at this time.
And it continues to get busier and busier.
So this is one of the top priorities, I think, from the convenience site standpoint.
It's getting this done.
So I think this is an important one for us to move forward.
Thank you, sir.
Any other questions?
Anyone?
Great.
Mr. Chairman.
I would move that we approve the 1.6 million dollars come from the capital fund for the building of the Auburn site.
Per dimension is our second.
Second.
Is there any discussion?
Anyone?
Supervisor McCarthy.
Hi.
Supervisor Slaughter.
Hi.
Supervisor Wells.
Hi.
Supervisor Powell.
Hi.
Supervisor Powell.
Hi.
Chair votes aye.
And the motion carries.
All right.
Thank you.
What will bring us to a public hearing?
Proposed adoption of amended articles of incorporation for the Frederick County Sanitation Authority?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I'll take that one.
Thank you, sir.
As you might recall at the board, September 25th meeting, at the request of Frederick Water,
the board authorized the public hearing regarding proposed revisions to the Frederick County Sanitation Authority,
doing business as Frederick Water articles of incorporation.
The proposed revisions would enable Frederick Water to own sewage treatment facilities in the future,
and also renews Frederick Water's term of existence for 50 years.
At the conclusion of tonight's public hearing, stay up to seeking board action on the proposed revisions to the articles of incorporation.
I'll note to Mr. Lawrence with Frederick Water is here.
Should the board have any questions?
Thank you, sir.
Any questions or Mr. Tips?
Anyone have questions or Mr. Lawrence?
Or anything you'd like to add, Mr. Lawrence.
Thank you, sir.
All right.
I want the board to handle this one.
It's a public hearing.
I'm sorry it is a public hearing.
Anyone like to comment on this proposed change to the incorporation articles of incorporation for Frederick Water?
Anyone at all?
Seeing none, we'll close the public hearing portion.
How would the board like to handle this one?
Mr. Chairman.
OK.
Yes.
I'd like the board to approve the proposed revisions to the articles of incorporation for Frederick Water.
Third dimension is our second.
Second.
There's a second.
Is there any discussion?
Are we ready?
Supervisor Trout.
Aye.
Supervisor Dyn.
Aye.
Supervisor Law.
Aye.
Supervisor Well.
Aye.
Supervisor Slogan.
Aye.
Supervisor McCarty.
Aye.
All right, sir.
Planning Commission Business Public here.
Ordnance amendments.
Mr. Ruddy.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Members of the Board of Supervisors.
This ordinance amendment that we have in front of us this evening deals with public utilities.
And what this proposed ordinance amendment seeks to provide is clear definitions for public utilities that include utility scale solar power energy generating facilities.
Utility scale solar power generating facilities and decommissioning.
Those second two, if you will, definitions were requested by the Board of Supervisors during our discussion of this item.
What the ordinance amendment also does it provides additional regulations for the utility scale solar generating facilities to make those arrangements necessary for decommissioning in a manner consistent with the state code.
It's an additional requirement that would also require a site plan be approved through Frederick County.
So again, that is the purpose of this amendment for public utilities utility scale solar.
Again, the intent is to codify what utility scale solar power generate rating facilities is described in the county's ordinance.
And it also, again, codifies those changes to the code regarding decommissioning.
What you will notice throughout the amendments is a variety of changes to different sections that provides consistency in the terminology for public utilities throughout the county's zoning ordinance.
The history of the review of this particular application, excuse me, this particular amendment goes back to the DRC which discussed the item at June 27th, July 25th and August 22nd meetings.
The DRC supported the changes. This item was then discussed by the Planning Commission on September 4th and the Board of Supervisors and the 25th of September.
Again, with the two requested definitions added, the Board moved it forward to public hearing.
The Commission had their public hearing on October 16th and recommended approval.
And we're here this evening for the Board of Supervisors to provide a direction on this proposed ordinance amendment for public utilities to include utility scale solar facilities.
Again, to codify the current definition that includes that. Mr. Chairman, I'd be happy to try and answer any questions you may have.
Questions of Mr. Ruddy, anyone? Supervisor Dunn?
In a decommissioning process, does the county have control on that decommissioning?
For example, if the Board approves something in year one and 20 years later or 30 years later, those that put those solar panels in come back and say we want to change something.
Does the county get to approve that? I know you made this promise 30 years ago.
You need to honor your promise as opposed to go, for example, the Mining and Energy Committee in Richmond, which reminds us of capability of overriding what the county does.
Yes, sir. That is a local standard with the guarantee, if you will, that comes through the bonding.
While it's consistent with the state code language, that is a guarantee that is provided with the county.
So the county will have control on the decommissioning at some future point in time.
That's correct.
The second related question is.
As long as it's in conformance with the state code.
Valid point.
Thank you. Mr. Chairman.
And then one other comment is the bonding.
A thousand dollar bond today is going to be worth a lot less, 20 years from now or 30 years from now, which is a lifetime for these.
Is the bonding in today's dollars? Is the bonding in potential future dollars at the time of decommissioning?
Because that's what you're trying to guarantee.
And there is an inflation factor.
Yes, sir. The legislation with regards to decommissioning provides the flexibility to ensure that there are annual inflationary factors that go along with the particular amount.
So, you know, again, the way it is described, if I may hear, pursuant to the code of Virginia, the decommissioning, again, that state code component gives you the flexibility to ensure that any changes increases, if you will, in the bonding amount is covered within the, within the guarantee that is put forward and accepted by the county.
Other questions, anyone of Mr. Ruddy?
Thank you.
Sir?
I say thank you.
Anyone?
Any questions in my comments?
Mr. Ruddy, so my understanding is that before site plan approval is given that there is a written agreement regarding the decommission process that's entered into between the landowner or the utility with the county.
Is that correct?
That's correct.
If the county determines that decommissioning plan isn't sufficient at what level is that determined?
Is that determined at the administrative level? Is that determined at the board level?
And what happens if the landowner disagrees with the decision that's rendered by whatever level that's brought forward?
It would be done at the time or should I say prior to them actually developing the site as you will recall there's a requirement that a site plan is provided and approved by Frederick County prior to any or the commencement of any activity.
It's at that time that the details associated with the bonding would be secured and guaranteed.
And how do we determine what's appropriate and not appropriate at that administrative level?
It's a very good question. I think the way it has proposed is that specific to the state code, if I can just take one second here and pull that back up, based upon an estimate of a professional engineer licensed in the Commonwealth who was engaged by the applicant with experience in preparing decommission estimates and approved by the locality.
Again, that ties us directly back to the state code through the approval of the site plan process.
An expert engineer would have to provide that and of course that would have to be endorsed by Frederick County to before we find it acceptable.
I guess that kind of answers my question. I guess at the administrative level, how does the elected official, the policy maker, convey what the current expectation is of what's sufficient.
I know there are certain parameters from the state code, but at what level do we determine if this was a CUP, we would sit here and debate it and we would come to a conclusion.
But if this is at the administrative level, and what way do we transmit that information?
The way we currently should sort of use an example, we require bonding now on road construction and things of that nature so that if you come in and we approve a development, we want to make sure that the development gets completed.
So there's a construction device that's reviewed by our public works department for a legitimate figure as to what it would take to construct those roads and it's bonded to that amount.
So it would be a similar process. Obviously this is a little different because we don't have experience with solar facilities. So certainly the first few we make higher consulting engineer to review whatever estimate the manufacturer or the applicant gives us to give us that.
Comfort level that it's a legitimate decommissioning price, but that we would use a professional recognized engineer expert to verify whatever number we get.
So on the flip side of that question, if the applicant disagrees with whatever termination has made at the administrative level, are they then able to appeal that decision and what effect does that have on the county at that point? Are we then locked in to whatever some third-party expert as determined as a feasible?
And again, to use that construction example, there are times where someone objects to they bring us a bonding amount. We say it's not enough.
They object and typically it ends up in the county minister's office to try and negotiate or settle the dispute.
So I don't know that we can give you an exact process or formula, but the appeal would be the applicant objects to what we're requiring and they would voice those objections and we'd have to resolve it.
But I don't know that I can sit here and tell you exactly how that would be done.
Is there a judicial resolution?
I think Mr. Chairman, Mr. McCarthy, I think the quote-unquote Doomsday scenario there is by analogy to what would happen with the public works bond review is ultimately if the parties weren't able to reach agreement, presumably the county, relevant county staff would deny the approval at which point then the applicant, the owner, would presumably if they felt that strongly about it and were so incentivized they would pursue legal action to reverse the county's decision.
Mr. Chairman, I'll fill up with one more thought.
So this may be a bit of a question for the county attorney.
So would the county per se have more control over the destiny of these types of facilities?
If we did this as a CUP where on a case-by-case basis we were approving these versus taking the chance that a court could force it upon us if they felt it was more reasonable than not to move forward with the project?
I don't think that CUP versus by right changes that part of the analysis.
The board obviously would have more control in terms of choosing of locations in the CUP process, but as far as the details of it, in fact actually the CUP process, if the board were to deny a CUP,
the owner can just as easily appeal that denial decision as well.
Thank you.
Other questions?
No, just a comment kind of segueing into Supervisor McCarthy's.
You know, talking about the CUP's, I frankly think that may be a better way for us to address, and I'm not a fan of CUP's, but there have been a dramatic increase of these construction facilities across the street.
There is very limited oversight with the state or regulations governing the siding of the facilities, and we could see any number of these facilities in Frederick County.
It is possible that there may be some areas that we may or may not want the facilities under the proposed wording, there would be nothing we could do about it.
And so I feel like that with regard to the utility scale solar that it would be better for us to look at it in the RA district as a conditional use, and I frankly would like to request that we postpone the action tonight on the amendment and send it back to planning staff so that we could have draft language that would make utility scale solar a conditional use.
I've heard the motion.
Second.
Second, then the second.
Now we're in discussion of the motion to send it back to staff with the request that they evaluate.
It's the CUP process to apply to this.
I would agree with that.
I certainly understand the owner of land was right to do with his land, and I certainly don't want to usurp that ability for him to do it.
However, in Frederick County, we have other neighbors are next door.
And I think with CUPs, we have an opportunity to direct how that facility is going to perform, be built, how the neighbors may be protected with buffers and so forth and so on.
Without that, I don't think we have that.
That's my opinion.
Okay, since we've already gotten down this path, I'll take any other comments, but this is a public hearing.
So before we deal with it any further, I think we should hear from them.
Absolutely.
Okay.
All right.
The moment, Mr. Ruddy, thank you, sir.
So this is a public hearing.
Would anyone like to comment concerning these amendments to the chapter 165 zoning article one?
Anyone at all?
Anyone?
Last call?
Seeing no one, we'll close the public hearing portion.
So there was a motion proposed, which you will confirm now for me.
Yes, sir.
And the second, which I think I heard from Supervisor McCarthy, so now we'll discuss that motion.
Yes, sir.
So Mr. Chairman, one of the things I'd like to add to this is slaughter's comments to staff would be that in a solar for industrial use.
If one person goes and puts in a 600 acre, 1,000 acre solar operation, that's near a transmitter transmission.
It's easy to do.
That's one item.
But it's put it in a way that it's away from that.
Or if that developer decides to go and put in batteries to store that solar energy, is that covered under this?
Or is that not covered?
Because if you have solar situations with batteries, they have a potential, not a potential environmental issue, if those batteries fail.
So I'd just like to clear the thought process on that.
Honestly, I do not know the answer to that particular question.
Okay, let's go.
We can give it to you.
So this is going back to planning.
We ought to give them an opportunity to do their work.
And I think that your questions can be answered.
Okay.
And I'm confident it will be.
That's correct.
And obviously, ultimately, the direction is that it goes back to through the planning commission.
The consideration is a conditional use that, in any additional comments, that the board may have.
We would make sure or incorporate it into what comes back to the board.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, sir.
Anything else from Mr. Ruddy?
Thank you.
Anything else for discussion?
All those in favor?
Aye.
Okay, I was no.
Send it back to planning.
We'll see what a CUP process might look like.
I would like for you to be sure that you consult council on that.
Thank you, sir.
Okay.
That'll bring us to a public hearing.
Ordnance amendment for every county.
165 again.
Right.
Thank you.
Again, Mr. Chair.
We're here to discuss conditional uses in the rural areas owning district.
And if you recall, the Board of Supervisors previously directed the planning commission to evaluate the CUP process.
And those listed conditional uses to ensure that the uses and the scale of the uses were appropriate for the zoning district in which they were allowed.
And that is what you have in front of you here this evening.
The purpose, again, being to add clarity to specific uses where the intensity of that use is an important consideration in the approval of the CUP.
And it also seeks to provide some consistency in the implementation of certain uses.
You'll notice their home occupation, cottage occupation, kennel discussion.
What you will see in the amendments provides further definition to the conditional use specifically country general store, which would then exclude all fuel sales and cap the square footage allowed at 3500 square feet.
It provides additional regulations for a couple of the specific uses, including country general store.
It eliminates, combines, and refines certain other conditional uses.
If you can see the whole list that's included within your agenda package motels, if you will, there's another one that's been struck from the list.
And a couple of others have moved up to the permitted use.
So again, it's a cleanup exercise, if you will, to those uses that are identified.
And again, finally, it codifies recent zoning determinations that relate to home occupations, cottage occupations, and kennels again to provide some consistency throughout the ordinance.
Similar to the previous one, but the DRC reviewed this in August.
Supported the proposed changes as did the planning commission and board when it was discussed at their meetings during the June September.
Any commission held their public hearing on October the 16th and recommended approval and looked much like the previous one we're here seeking a decision and action from the board of supervisors on the proposed amendment to conditional uses in the rural areas.
Questions of Mr. Ruddy, anyone?
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Is the public hearing would anyone like to comment concerning the proposed changes to chapter 165 article one conditional uses?
Anyone?
Last call.
The end of one will close the public hearing portion of the discussion.
I would the board like to handle this one.
Mr. Chairman.
I would move for approval of the minute ordinances presented.
Second.
Motion.
And the second.
Is there any discussion?
All those in favor, aye.
Mr. Chairman.
That would need to be a roll call to the ordinance.
Thank you, sir.
Mr. President McCarthy.
Aye.
Mr. President Slotter.
Aye.
Mr. President Will.
Aye.
Mr. President Lofton.
Aye.
Mr. President done.
Aye.
Chair votes, aye.
And the motion carries.
Thank you, Mr. Williams.
All right.
We're liaison reports are the rainy.
No one.
Citizen comments.
The opportunity for citizens to comment and discuss the word comment to the board on any issue, any issue at all.
Anyone like to comment to the board?
Yes, ma'am.
Could I have your name, magisterial district, and limit your comments to three minutes or less, please?
Hello.
I'm Carrie Ankeight.
I'm an associate member of the American Institute of Architects and a resident of the Shawnee District.
At the AIA regional conference last week, I was reminded how design matters in our lives.
Design can prevent the spread of disease and determine how we move through spaces.
And design can also be used in crime prevention.
We have attended visibility, risk mitigation, and school design.
And this focused on septet, the crime prevention through environmental design.
Septet is based on the principle that appropriate environmental design can increase the perceived likelihood of detection and apprehension known to be the biggest single deterrent to crime.
Proper design can lead to an improvement in the quality of life for citizens.
That session referred to case studies showing transparency as natural surveillance.
The use of windows and public schools has increased around the country over the years, specifically because of the concept of septet.
It seems counterintuitive that more glass equals more security, but the research supports this.
I came away fully confident in our new school designs.
They're using the latest in crime prevention strategies and minimal changes using these methods can also help to make green wood mill a safer community property as well.
Some have questioned why square footage in schools vary and why our schools are getting bigger and more expensive.
The Americans with Disability Acts passed in 1990 made every building after this time conform to new regulations adding square footage, including classrooms, hallways, and bathrooms.
Things before then like James Wood Middle, James Wood High School, and Ailer were not built with these larger standards.
Upgraded designs like doorless entry bathrooms and motion sensors, add square foot and cost, but they reduced the spread of illness and deterred bad behavior.
With state funding tied to attendees attendance, this is also a need.
And if you look at the Virginia Department of Education data, a sharp increase in square footage started after the Sandy Hook shooting.
Along with material increase in cost, schools have increased security adding additional costs to construction.
At the same time, the VDOE guidelines added more stringent guidelines for site and environmental concerns and energy efficiency.
Also adding cost across the entire state.
And starting this year, all school plans must be reviewed for active shooter risk mitigation, adding cost and time.
The fourth high school is the top of the school's CIP list this year.
Look past what the building looks like and please consider how it functions.
The architects and engineers are creating learning environments that adhere to the latest technology required for education and safety.
They're keeping our students safe from crime, safe from disease, and safe from bullies.
Energy efficiency can be more costly upfront, but safe thousands in annual operating expenses.
And most of all, they are creating an environment that is optimal for learning.
Transparency is a good thing.
These schools may look a lot different than the schools when we were younger, but we were not living in the same times.
We are serving a more diverse population in terms of physical and mental ability, and we are serving a population who have grown up knowing school shootings can happen anywhere.
I am not employed by any firm that does design for schools.
I am simply advocating for the profession and for the students of our community.
Please let us follow the research, keep our schools safe, and support the education and design professionals as they do their job in designing your schools.
Thank you, and I have some information.
Thank you.
If you could leave that with Mr. Tibbs or you're seeing anyone else?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Board.
You're going to have to help that.
My name is John Wright and president of the Frederick County Professional Firefighters Association, local 41-45 and a resident of the Redbud District.
I just wanted to offer a few words tonight to Supervisor Trout as her time on this board comes to a close.
Two years ago, the Shawnee District and this community got hooked on Trout.
And, man, did we catch a good one?
I hope this board will keep this in mind and seek a replacement that fits the mold of Shannon and what her constituents voted to elect until a special election can be held.
Shannon on behalf of all firefighters on the job here in Frederick County, thank you for your unwavering support on addressing the issues that we face every single day.
Your voice of reason and advocacy for our firefighters, our deputies, our schools, and our county services will be sorely missed.
Thank you for all your words of wisdom and working for the greater good of our growing community.
We wish you your husband and your family the very best and as a token of our appreciation, please accept this helmet.
Complete with leather shield engraved with your name and our proud IAF logo.
You have earned it.
Job well done.
Thank you, sir.
All right. Anyone else like to address the board on any subject at all? Anyone?
You want it all?
Then we'll close the citizen comment portion of the meeting and if the board would permit me under board comments to address supervisor Trout.
And let you know how much of a pleasure it has been serving with you.
Thank you. We will miss you.
You have served with great dedication and distinction.
And we wish you all the very best as we move forward.
We'll miss you here.
Other comments from the board?
I do.
Two things.
Number one.
We had a ribbon cutting in my district opening up another portion of Charando Park.
Now, the warrior drop.
And if you haven't had an opportunity to go by there and see that, it's exciting.
And I think you really enjoy it.
It's used daily.
Our Parks and Recreation Department does a great job.
There's other things to come that will be out there that will even make it even better.
But it is.
And I also want to thank V.Dot for their help and financial assistance in getting grants that help us do that.
It's much appreciated.
We have great guys in our community here that work with V.Dot.
The other thing is, top of Virginia Builders Association understands that not everyone is going to go to college.
And there should be some opportunities for those folks to participate in vocational activities.
And we're working very hard.
I remember that group working very hard to provide some of that.
Last year, two groups that we had started were fortunate enough to go to the International Building Institute.
The conference and participate in our group from Hamley.
Got an honorable mention.
It was our first year there.
So we're very proud of them.
We'd like to send two groups this year.
It takes money to do that.
And we're asking for contributions.
And I will lay these out on the table over there.
It doesn't have to be a big amount.
It can be $5 or $10.
Whatever you can do.
It would certainly be appreciated.
And it helps these young folks to understand that there are some other jobs out there.
Other than doctors and lawyers and Indian chiefs.
And we really need those folks.
We need them in our community.
They're a great benefit to us.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.
Anyone else?
It's a surprise of a car.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Two days ago we observed Veterans Day.
And I think it's unfortunate that we only take a few days a year to recognize the Veterans Day.
So even though today's not Veterans Day, I wish I'd be belated Veterans Day to all of those who serve our country.
Thank you for all the sacrifice and support that you've given us.
Because we wouldn't have the right to sit here at this desk and make these decisions and have the representative democracy that we have without the sacrifice that our veterans have made in those who have given their lives for our country.
That's the first thing I want to say.
The first thing I want to say.
The second thing I want to say.
Shannon, when you join the board, I know as well as you.
It's a great adventure.
It's also.
You're going into the unknown.
You never know how things are going to turn out.
I think you're finding out very quickly.
Marriage is an even greater adventure with unknowns and things.
I wish you and your husband the very best on the new adventure that you're undertaking.
And we'll miss you.
Anyone else?
It's your turn.
It's your turn.
Didn't you win?
Absolutely.
That's your turn.
It's your turn.
It's your turn.
I just want to wish Supervisor proud.
All the best in the future.
I've enjoyed working with her.
I know that you will have a long, lustrous career song of the list.
Thank you.
Supervisor Dyn.
Mr. Turner, I have three items to bring.
The first item is, Mr. Terry and I went to a bakel conference.
I thought it was informative, educational.
It encourage you all to come and join us next year.
We have issues dealing with taxes, environmental issues, et cetera.
And if we all came down, I think we might have a bigger impact.
One of the items discussed was giving counties the same taxing authorities, municipalities.
We talked about solar, we talked about building, we talked about growth, and
sort of a lot of items that I think would just appreciate all your input on.
So I'd just encourage you next year to consider going to that.
The second item, as Mr. McCarthy said, two days ago was a, was a veteran to stay.
And my wife and I were going and door knocking in this recent election.
And we met him, gentlemen, he said, you see the guy over there?
He's a veteran too.
And we talked to him.
Very unassuming, 93 years old, he just asked him, are you a veteran?
He said yes.
What he forgot to mention was he was one of the veterans, the land on Omaha Beach.
Second wave, first wave, nothing but dead people.
Second wave, they took heavy casualties.
He is the most unassuming gentleman you'll see.
But without people like him, in which the expected casualty rate was 80%, 8 out of 10 were
not expected to survive, yet to respect people like that.
So for Mr. Pope, Mr. Leon Pope, thank you very much for your service.
For those of you who teach history, ask them to come and talk.
It's one thing to read in a history book about the invasion of Normandy.
It's one thing to read about the history book about people on Omaha Beach.
It's another thing that shake hands with that person to talk to that person.
Look at my eye and see what he had to say.
Generalizing our road and letter, which is on the Pentagon next to the Secretary of Defense's
Office, it said, dear Mr. President, I'm sorry we failed.
It was no guarantee in Normandy that it would be successful.
So Mr. Pope, thank you very much for your service.
And finally, Mrs. Trout, thank you for your service.
We've agreed on some things, we've disagreed on some things.
But you know what I really appreciate?
I appreciate your willingness to go and say, Lane, I disagree, make a stand and do so.
And Mr. Wright, it was very, very thoughtful of you.
I tip my hat to you on what you did here.
That is just complimentary, good job.
I really appreciate what you did on behalf of your Association for Ms. Trout.
Mrs. Trout, I apologize.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Supervisor Trout.
Thank you.
I do have some comments regarding leaving.
But before I do that, I'd like to make a motion since my last meeting and all.
I'd like to make a motion to set a public hearing to guide the county budget process
for the first meeting in January, which I believe is January 8th,
so that we can hear public comment before we enter budget season.
I can't accept it.
Because I'm leaving.
I'm on the agenda and we're past that part of the business.
Mr. Chairman, okay.
Do you understand the sentiment that we heard that?
Somebody make a motion at the next meeting so that that actually happens since we've been discussing it so much.
Okay.
Okay, so comments.
It's truly been an honor to serve the citizens of Frederick County and the constituents of the Shawnee district in this capacity.
Two years ago, I spent an entire summer and fall campaigning, mostly knocking on doors every spare minute of my life.
During this time, I had the privilege of meeting numerous constituents with a variety of backgrounds and expectations of local government.
As I met hundreds of new people, I began to feel like I had a clear pulse on the priorities and goals of the majority of the Shawnee community.
I was humbled when the voters chose to represent them and I promised to be their voice on this board.
From the bottom of my heart, thank you for trusting me in this role and for allowing me to serve.
In the past two years, I've learned a great deal about local government from my fellow board members, from county staff and from the community.
Although I thought I did, I really had no idea what this role entailed and I'm internally grateful for this experience.
So thank you for your time and your patience as I learned how to function in this role.
Even though the members of this board don't often agree, we are always respectful and civil.
For that, I am truly appreciative.
As for my constituents, thank you for being involved and for your support.
I hope you will continue to be involved after my departure.
If you continue to be involved and voice your opinions and concerns, the future of the county will be bright.
I encourage this board to continue to listen to the constituents and plan for the future of our community.
I encourage you to be proactive in your funding allocations, especially regarding our public services,
including but not limited to the school division, police and fire and rescue.
I'm sorry to leave the area prior to the end of my term.
It was not my intention when I ran for this office.
For those of you that don't know, I got married in September in Mr. Board meeting.
And my husband, a member of the U.S. Air Force has been reassigned to BL Air Force Base in California.
We are actually moving tomorrow.
In closing, actually driving away tomorrow.
They packed up my house yesterday.
In closing, I slept on an air mattress last night.
In closing, I trusted the board role point, a suitable replacement to fill my spot on the board.
As Mr. Williams and Mr. Wright both stated during citizen comment,
I would also request that this person have similar values and priorities as myself.
Until Frederick County can have a special election, and the constituents of Shawnee can make a choice for themselves.
Thank you again.
Also, thank you, Mr. Wright and the Fire Fighter Association.
I really can't articulate how grateful I am for this gift.
Thank you.
Godspeed.
Vice Chairman Lofton.
Chairman, move your adjourned.
Mr. adjourns their second.
Those in favor, aye.
The aye.
The aye.
Thank everyone for their time and attention.
We'll stand adjourned.
