I my family, my wife Julie, my son Sam, who's seven, we have a daughter,
Cece, who's five, and a daughter Ruby, who's three.
We live right across Route 11 from Mr. and Mrs. Clayter in one of the original
height homes that's right beside Springdale Mill.
And I understand Mr. Gregory's request.
I've read all the documents that were posted, and I have to agree with my neighbors.
We're actually a community that's been around for a long time.
In the Bartonsville area, my great-great-grandparents lived in the White
Clapboard House, which is right beside our current house, and my great-uncle
J.I. milled that mill from 1923 until 1981.
So I have a distinct appreciation for this particular area.
I brought my family here back to the Valley to raise them in this type of community.
And then I see that, you know, we want to, or there's been a request to rezone the
19 acres that we're discussing into a B3 district, which, according to your own staff
report, includes heavy intensive uses.
And I'm not only concerned that the rezoning will change the historical character of
our neighborhood, but it will also lead to the inundation of heavy equipment, tractor
trailers, construction support equipment, and then the associated noise and site pollution.
You know, and to touch on what Mr. Wakefield said, we spent significant time about five
years ago going through a study about whether we want to lay the historical area over
Bartonsville.
Everyone agreed that it was something that was in the best interest of the county, and
it was in the best interest of the citizens.
So in reading, which I put in my letter to you guys, I won't read tonight, but reading
the five goals of historical area overlay zone, and an heavy industrial park does not help
meet or achieve any of those goals.
So I can't imagine how putting an industrial park, a budding and adjacent to historical
area, could help preserve the historical character of that neighborhood.
Further to touch on the map right up there, you'll see all of the land that there is
there in the orange yellow, is owned by Mr. Gregory, including the 60 acre parcel just
to the west.
So I could see in the future, well, we zone this B3, well, let's just go ahead and put
a request in a couple of years to zone the next one B3, and then that little one down
there B3, and next thing you know you've got a 100 acre industrial park, right adjacent
to historical area, and then to build on top of that, the request that they're putting
through the county right now to extend a road into the industrial park from the end of
Springdale road, you have 646 cars, maybe you have 1575 vehicles, summer cars, summer
heavy construction equipment.
Let's just say 10% of those vehicles decide to use the back exit, we'll call it, and
come down Springdale road, past seven different houses, seven different families, seven
different kids, seven different dogs, right there, coming down Springdale road.
But I ask you guys to actually go and drive the road before you make a decision, because
that map doesn't do it justice.
You know, prior to the dam bursting, that there was an entire, you know, the mill pond
was there, but so the road was built around the mill pond.
So you're talking about an aggressive S-turn and almost 90 degree hairpin turn on that
road.
Right now the FedEx trucks like to come down that road at least once a day, and at
least once a month I see a heavy record headed up there to pull somebody off one of the
S-turns or off the hairpin turn or off the railroad tracks.
So you know, I like to think of the second and third order effects of what this particular
request is going to achieve.
It's not just 19 acres, it could be a domino effect to 100 acres and 1500 cars, 1500 trucks
coming down Springdale road, which is right through the heart of our community.
So I would ask you guys to, like I said, to take a trip down Springdale and pretend you
live there.
And if that, would you want this type of industrial part to be in your backyard?
Thanks for your time.
Anyone else?
Yes, sir.
Well, I got two stand up at the same time, but I missed, come on there.
I'll catch you next, sir.
Hi, my name is Stacy Raul, and I'm here with my husband, Michael Raul.
We own the properties at 115 and 117 Springdale road.
So majority of our property is right there on the road frontage of Springdale.
We already have to deal with the traffic that has been going through now and the dangers
and we have to watch our children when we're out there to make sure that they're not even
just anywhere near the road at this point.
I did submit a letter, and I'm not going to reiterate everything that I did because
of time, but I wanted to hit a couple points here.
A while back ago, I did spend a couple hours with Mr. and Mrs. Gregory, and I explained to
them how we were actively doing a floodplain study on the Springdale property, where the
mill is and where the hundred year floodplain.
The reason for this is that we were looking to build a residential home on the backside
of the parcel.
When Mr. Gregory had one of his residential homes burned to the ground from the renters,
we had gone to him directly and asked if he would be willing to sell approximately two
acres to where we could build a house there and then not have to worry about trying to
deal with the complexities of the flood study.
His exact words to me first was he was hoping to put in a water park, and I said okay,
like great well-flodged, and he had already tried to reach out to them.
I said well that was very interesting, and then he told me that it would not be in my
interest to build a home on my property because I would just have to be looking at an industrial
park.
Those were his exact words to me, and so I talked to him about easement rights because we
both share the right way into the Springdale roads, and he just said we don't think we're
interested in this time.
You can maybe talk to us later, but we really have full plans to have storage buildings
back there, and it's not going to be fun to look at if you're trying to build a home
back there.
You might want to look at another place to build, and pretty much shut me down right
then and there.
I appreciate what he's trying to do for himself and his family, and I'm not trying to
manage that in any way, but I'm also not trying to diminish what I would like to do and
what my husband would like to do for our family, and that is to be able to utilize our property,
allow our children to go play down at the Opec and Creek, a couple of weeks ago they
found a civil war boot in the Opec and Creek, just playing in it, and it is something that
we go enjoy on a regular basis, and we've enjoyed with Shaefer and his family, and you
know, they enjoy coming down to the Creek with their children, and we do keep with the
road, the house in front, we have family there, and we've also been meeting with Piony
Engineering regarding the cul-de-sac that's going to be put onto our property.
We had asked why was our property the only one chosen for the cul-de-sac, and not
Gregory's as well, but he, so the cul-de-sac is completely going on our property, but Mr.
Gregory would have the right-away allowability to the cul-de-sac, and we are still in communication
with the county and with V.Dodd regarding the size of the cul-de-sac, but they said the
reason the necessity of the cul-de-sac for dead-ending is for school buses, because of all
the school children on Springdale Road, and that's why we have to have that there, and
that it was from Ron at Piony Engineering, and they have to be able to, and V.Dodd has
to be able to be able to turn their trucks around and the school bus around, that was
the main debate, so I can't imagine giving right-away access to Mr. Gregory to allow more
industrial vehicles to transfer through to this cul-de-sac, that is the biggest concern for
the county and for V.Dodd to allow for the school bus. I understand that the initial rezoning does
not include that back parcel, but I know that he pipping enterprises owns 155 plus acres out there,
and I know what Mr. Gregory has said to me personally, and his comments to me had always been
concerning, but due to the massive profits and due the fact that there is already an industrial
park on Shady Elm that has not been fully utilized at this point and is still majorly underdeveloped
why we would just spot drop an industrial park in an agricultural area. This is a historical
land, this is beautiful land we are as we've only owned the property since 2015, but our
long-term goals is to retire there, to be able to, you know, restore the history, and we've
worked closely with the family members, and we've even, you know, had many talks with
Shaefer and his family about preserving the life and the history of the Martinsville area.
So we just hope you take into this serious consideration of what impact this zoning is going to
have long-term on this community. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Anyone else, sir? I see you in the back.
Yes or you? Yes.
Hi, my name is Lance Moss. I'm at 4527 bottom right there. I just wanted to chime in a couple
pragmatic things, if you take notes. So everybody's a Springdale road. You can't have trucks on
Springdale Road. You've all been on that road, right? I jog it. I actually got ready for a marathon
and then they cancel it because of COVID. COVID isn't that, but anyway, there's also an
insurance right now. I could gravel road from the golf course, like from the parking lot.
So just speak up. There goes on to there. Could we make sure that that, because I can see that
becoming a loop where they use the, you know, if you make a wrong turn, you loop back
with all the respect, does that make sense? I hope that makes sense because that would be,
that would definitely affect me because that parking lot comes right in front of me.
No big deal. Just something I would like to just put on record that it would be really, you
should just combine this to the Pippin Road. If this has to happen, it should just be Pippin Road.
There shouldn't be a way out of that. Also, can anybody answer the question? Is B3 have hours?
Does that have operating hours? Is it 24-7? Don't typically answer.
Okay. Well, I would have to answer that. It'd be a bummer if it was 24-7. The, the Gregory's
are great neighbors. They've always been great. It's just obviously the future of what would go down.
24-7 would not be really cool. I have business hours that I'm my CUP says I have to
follow, but I'm not B3. I guess that was just, I wanted to chime in on Springdale Road.
I guys are discussing something that's pretty far north and interesting that that's getting
affected. And just from my personal selfish reasons, I just want to make sure that there's no
connection between the lot that is the golf course parking lot, the the batting cage parking lot
into that section. That would help me a ton. Thanks, sir. Thank you. Appreciate it. Anyone else?
One last call. I'll get back to you. One last call. Not, no one else. I'll close the public hearing.
And at this time, I'll staff and the applicant does have a response. You would like to come back.
Can the applicant come forward, please? Because I do have time for that.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Clayter was right. We've known each other a long time.
He's done a lot of development. He understands traffic.
I will say, and this will address comments from every one of the speakers. We are not asking for
the comprehensive plan to be amended, said that the Steven City bypass runs down Pippin Lane.
We are not asking for that. We are making provisions. Should the planning commission and the
board of supervisors choose to do that at some future time. But for those in, I believe
some of the speakers spoke to the comprehensive plan process that was accomplished for the
area out there. They're probably aware that the Steven City bypass has always connected up
to Springdale Road. Now, I used to live out there, and Springdale is not the place for a truck.
I'm not sure it's the place for a school bus, and it's certainly not the place for young drivers.
It's narrow, it's windy, and it's just not a place for trucks. So we understand that. Again,
we are not looking to put our traffic on that road. That would be a huge mistake for Mr. Gregory,
as well as for the citizens that live along there. The sewer capacity, again, we're going to,
we're willing to abandon the septic. We have spoken with Gary Oates, he feels like that the sewer
capacity associated, or the sewer being generated by these buildings is going to be small.
There will not be a lot of people in these buildings, a small office with warehousing operations,
so it's not going to generate a lot of sewer capacity, a sewer that will need capacity,
so he feels like that could be accommodated. We have done everything we can to try to
minimize the impact on the historic district. We are not getting into the historic district
with us, but we understand there is a historic district there. We have an appreciation for the
historic district and understand why it's there, and certainly support what's going on in the
historic district. But at the same time, Mr. Gregory would like to develop this property in a
manner that is conducive with what he'd like to accomplish there with his business and
be able to carry that forward, but nothing else can happen on that property as far as additional
reasonings on the back of it, other lands that he owns, without this body taking some form of
action in the border supervisors taking a subsequent action. This is what we're asking for,
less than 20 acres, and anything beyond this would have to go back through the same process.
It's not an automatic giveaway should that be desired at some point in the future.
With that, I'll conclude my remarks again. Thank you very much.
Your questions for last time? Thanks, sir.
BC members, questions, discussion, Mr. Thomas.
I'm a staunch supporter of individual property rights, and the Gregory family is certainly a
solid family in Frederick County, and it's a solid business in Frederick County. But I have a
lot of concerns about this rezoning or potential rezoning, and I'm a little even concerned about some
of our staff comments where we say that it may be compliant with the comprehensive plan.
That kind of puts us in a real gray area, I think. I also think that we may, as a planning
commission, we may have made a mistake with our comprehensive plan. I'm not sure that area there
should be a commercial area, or if it is a commercial area, it should be a very light commercial
area, and not have the potential for B3 or B2 in that area. It's, you know, you're surrounded
on two sides by a historical area, and the Barton'sville area there is a small area, but it's a very
historic, a very pristine area. And I think this will have a significant impact on it.
I certainly would not go with a 50-foot buffer in the off of Route 11. I even think 150 feet
probably isn't sufficient to put it back there, because it's all uphill. Everything that's
up there is going to be seen from the road, and it's going to be seen from the Barton'sville area.
I think the the proffers are very weak. We could end up with something out there in five years or
ten years if the Gregory's sell it off or other things happen that is a very intensive use,
and there aren't proper sufficient to protect that property. I don't think there should be any
outside storage at all a lot. I mean, I've been in very many construction yards, and outside
storage in a construction yard is not the most attractive thing to look at unless you're a
construction guy. And I don't think most of the people in Barton'sville area are construction folks
that would want to look at it. The truck traffic, I think, is going to be very intense,
and the comment that most of it will go north past Barton'sville housing there is true. And 646
tractor trailers is an intense flow, even a 24-hour period, which most of that will probably be
doing today. I think the proffers need, like I already said this, I think the proffers need to be
much more extensive if we would consider this, and a lot more things need to be proffered at.
I think everything needs to be stored inside. I just think that that has a significant
significant impact on that area. I mean, across Route 11, it's a historical area,
but that little corner there's cut out, and it's not a historical area. And I don't understand that,
but I really think we made a mistake in our comprehensive plan. And I think that area should
be looked at again to see if that's really how we want to have it there. Personally, I don't
think the development there is appropriate. I think it should be much less intense and should
protect a surrounding area much more. All right. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Anyone else? Mr. Mo?
Excuse me. Just a piggyback on what Roger said. I think I agree with a lot of your sentiments.
I think that fundamentally this proposal doesn't align with the general plan, with our comprehensive
plan. So just out of the gate, I have some concerns with the proposal relative to what the plan
calls for and what the land use is. I do think that because it's a rezoning, we have the ability
to work with an applicant and the applicant to work with us to make sure the development fits.
It is on the edge. Something's going to be on the edge. And I think that being said,
there's a lot more that could be done. And I think there were comments about elevations,
things of that nature. I did take a quick look at the B3 district. I mean, it's 35 feet is the
height, which is the same as the B2 and the B1. But how that 35 feet is designed, what type of
buildings those are. These are flat roof buildings that are going to be set back there.
That's definitely not a contribution to that distinctive area that I think we'd be happy with.
And I don't think it's exactly what we're hoping for when we plan this area. So I agree that
there's more that needs to be done. If this proposal is going to go forward, I'm not sure how you
reconcile B3, which is heavy commercial with a plan for general commercial. I think just out of
the gate again, that's not quite right. And I think the comment about the general or the
comprehensive plan again is that, you know, if anything, if this was the intent and if this is
a bigger picture idea that the property owner has, then it really should have been a
comp plan amendment proposal first to give us an opportunity to really talk about what this
area should be. It wasn't that long ago that we did update the plan and we may have made a mistake,
but I think the mistake wasn't to under utilize or under plan if anything, it may be the other way.
But if we're going to move forward with anything that's going to be favorable here, I think there's
more work that needs to be done about the about the treatments of the area and how it fits.
So that's what I would be hoping for and looking for. And I'd actually encourage the property owner
to reconsider what they're proposing. Mr. Moon, I'll echo what they're saying. I think that
this needs some work and that'll when we start using the term that we made a mistake and
comprehensive plan. Yeah, we could have prior folks before us could have. So that'll mean we
compound, keep compounding something that we may have made a mistake and keep adding to it.
And it is a very pretty right age Springdale road. I did it again the day just to refresh my
memory and I'm concerned when I keep hearing the word cul-de-sac come up and they have the ability.
And I know we're not dealing with this parcel here. We deal with what's in front of us.
But when we keep hearing that that cul-de-sac on Springdale road because we knew about that,
then he has the potential this does have the potential. And I said here and think it'd be great
we had two ways out of Stonewall Industrial Park and we're going to have two out of 20 acres
out here potentially down the road. And even though we were dumping it into the residential,
so I do think it's needs some work. So I do agree with my two commissioners here that
you know it concerns me a little bit that well we need to maybe take a little look at this. But
with that being said that's my two cents with that being said I'll entertain a motion since there's
a more discussion. Mr. Chairman, this is back creep. Now it's certainly understandable that we cannot
scrutinize applicant because we've made a mistake on a comprehension plan.
Now you are asking or talking about more work. Are you speaking of maybe
postponing this for the applicant to come back with us for more work? Is this the work you're
speaking of? That's certainly an option, Mr. Martin. Yes, that's certainly an option.
Applicant could go back and work with staff to try it from what's been discussed here tonight.
The concerns been discussed that we've heard. So yes, that's definitely an option you can do.
And for what met the time Mr. Ruddy, can we postpone this?
Mr. Chairman, I would say a minimum of 45 days is what our bylaws cause for but if that's
sufficient time then so be it. If it takes a little bit longer then I would suggest
60 or 90 days I'm sure the applicant might want to give some idea about what they would be
comfortable with. Thank you Mr. Ruddy. Mr. Stowe, if we would 60 days be sufficient. I'm getting
that's Mr. Martin, maybe 60 days. If that's what you have in mind, yes.
All right Mr. Chairman, I'm going to make a motion for the rezoning of O220
for Pippin and industrial park that we postpone any decision on this application for 60 days.
I have a second. I'll second that. Okay, so I have a motion to postpone the application
for 60 days and I have a second. I'll start with Mr. Ambrosey.
Ambrosey, yes. Julia's. Arston, yes.
Ambrosey, yes. Hi, yes. Ambrosey, yes. Ambrosey, yes.
Arston, yes.
Chair votes, yes. It's postponed for 60 days. Thank you. Thank you for everyone.
Thank you for everyone to speak this week before tonight.
Next item on our agenda is also a public hearing item. It's
2022, 2025, agriculture and for sterile district update, Mr. Chair.
Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'm out of planning commission. Correct. This is the 2025 agriculture
for sterile district update. This is a public hearing to consider the renewal of the
urban apple pie ridge, double church, green spring, redbud, south Frederick, south timber ridge,
districts. The renewal of these districts was established a total of 10,779 acres. This
public hearing is also the consideration of two additional districts that have been added to
your Ag and Forestal districts. Those districts are the back mountain district with a total of 489
point 91 acres and a reliance district with a total of 203 acres. The total of 11,472 point 25
acres within the Ag and industrial Ag and forestal district program for the
ensuing five-year period. The properties are incorporated into the Ag and Forestal District
and are projected or excuse me, are guaranteed to start protection as specified in the code of
Virginia. Again, every five years, the Ag and Forestal district is renewed and the board
of supervisor sets up an agricultural and forestry advisory committee or more aid act.
This is also required by the code of Virginia. Again, their duty is to evaluate, renew,
or remove properties from the Ag and Forestal districts. They sort of vend it first. It comes
of course to the planning commission and ultimately to the board of supervisor final approval.
The creation of the seven districts this year and there are two new districts. There's
renew of the seven. We've actually added two or have asked to come in. One of the questions
is always asked at this board and the other board is what's the advantage of being an Ag and
Forestal district that comes all the time and basically it's you get a bonus density if you're
participating in the county's TDR program or transfer development rights program. So there's a
little added there. Of course, before you can get into that program, it has to be evaluated by
Frederick County to certain receiving areas. It's beyond the scope of what we're here tonight for,
but that's one of the advantages you have it. The other advantage of course is the land use
taxation. The third advantage is preserving the open space and protecting our pristine areas
and probably the most important and the last one they're all important would be to promote the
agribusiness and for long range agricultural planning. What it does basically is
call out through our comprehensive policy plan in our zoning ordinance that this is
the Ag and Forestal district. The property owners have volunteered to come in the district and
that's the key thing Mr. Chairman. It's a volunteer program and how we do with Frederick County's
volunteer to come in you can volunteer to come out. Also, it's not used as a planning toilet
but as you're well aware, I will be updating our comprehensive policy plan next year.
It's sort of like a yellow light if you will if you're going to do any development there
that the board of supervisors planning commission recognize that these districts are set aside
the property owners want to set it aside for agricultural.
The first one today, what I'm going to do now, Mr. Chairman, if you allow me,
is I'm going to review all the districts that we have and come back if there's any questions
that you would have planning commissioners may have on any one district with the maps and then
go ahead for the record. You can go ahead through the public, of course we have the public hearing
and if it's okay with you and the other planning commission we can vote on it for the safe time.
The first district is the Albin District. It's located in the Gainesboro,
District District. It currently has 1,014. This proposed 2025 district would contain the same
amount that was with the renew and hasn't changed. There hasn't been any additions or subtractions
from that district. If you turn your attention to the map on your left, it's outlined in the yellow.
So like I said, it's just the Albin District that was there five years ago.
The next district is the Apple Pie Ridge District. This is located in the Stonewall Magisterial
District. It currently has 889 acres and again, Mr. Chairman, this proposed district will still
contain the same amount of acres. There's none of them taking out our hand and added.
And there's the map, it kind of gives you outline of the district.
The next district is the Double Church Road District. It's located in the Opaque Magisterial
District and it contains 889.85 acres. It's the district will be reduced to 878
districts or acres with a stop date. There has been some property owners that wanted to come out.
And there's the map of that Double Church District.
The Green Springs District, it's located in Gainesboro, Magisterial District again,
contains 385.63 acres and two parcels or one of our smaller, not smaller districts, but
it has just two parcels in it. Some of the newer districts you'll be seeing tonight actually
have one parcel. This district again for the update would have the same amount of acres it had
five years ago. There was no additions for subtractions. Of course, the map.
The Redbud District is located within the Stonewall Magisterial District and this generally
runs parallel to Redbud Road. Now, this district currently contains 1,007.34 acres.
Five parcels have requested to be removed from the district, totaling 44.85 acres.
11 parcels have requested to be added to the district for a total of 58.56 acres.
The total acres for the 2025 district after considering the additions and subtractions will
increase from 1,007.34 to 1,000.46.96 acres. This includes 125 acres that has been requested
and it was received after the ADAC meeting. So what had happened is we had sent notices about
the agricultural force of the district. We post the signs up because it's a public hearing.
Some folks look at it and our policy has been for the county's posture as we come right up
until the Board of Supervisors meeting. If someone wants to come in, we'll just adjust the
mapping or just the resolutions at that time. So what happened, we did get some additional
property owners after seeing the signs, called staff, requested to come in. We added them and that's
what you're seeing here tonight. It's not reflected on the map you're seeing. This is just the
outline of the district of the above magisterial district. That will be updated as we move forward.
On the South Frederick agricultural force of district is located in the Bakery Magisterial
district. It currently contains 5,764.21 acres. 13 parcels of this district have requested to be
removed from the district. Tolling 1016.32 acres. 20 or excuse me, 32 parcels have requested
to be added to the district. Tolling 862.15 acres. The total acres of the 2020 and 2025 district
after considering the additions and the subtractions will be reduced by 5,764 acres.
In it, the remaining will be 5,610.4 acres. Again, the map, it's actually two
maps. This is a bigger district in terms of the area what it's covering for the South Frederick.
South Timberidge district is located in the Gainesboro Magisterial district. It contains 17
parcels which have 981.08 acres. It's managed by one property owner. This proposed 20,
2025 district will contain 981.0 acres. It was the same as when it was created and there was no
additional subtractions from the district. Here's the South Timberidge district on your map.
Finally, we're coming through our two new districts. This proposed new district is called the
Back Mountain District. The proposed district is located in the Bakery Magisterial district.
The proposed district will have one parcel of 489.91 acres to your map on the left.
If you're familiar with the Bakery district, it's located just outside the mountain falls sub-vision.
It's controlled by one property owner and they're requesting to come in to our Ag and Forest
of District programs. That's one of your first new districts. The second new district is the
Reliance Agricultural Force of District. This is the Bakery Magisterial district. It's located
along how to road and handy road. The proposed district will consist of five parcels containing 203
acres. Again, this is one of our additions to our current districts and there's the aerial map
that the district is outlined. The ADAC did meet on the 25th of June of this year and
recommended the renewal of the districts and the creation of two new districts. One request for
an additional, excuse me, one request for an addition to the Redbot district was received
that total was 125.91 acres. With all the acres that we have, what the new ones came in,
all the district will total 11,599 to 8.24 acres with the additional Redbot property.
So this, again, Mr. Chairman, is a public here. For separate actions are needed for the following
to update the ag districts, which are updating the districts I just went over. The creation
of the proposed Bakery district and Reliance district will give all the districts a total
1,589 or 98.24 acres. If adopted, it will be in our Ag of Forestal District.
And one other word, Mr. Chairman, just because I know we're on folks could still, if they're
interested, contact staff on this district, even though it hadn't gone to the ADAC, unless it's a new
district, staff will look at it and we'll move forward to the board's supervisor. That, Mr. Chairman,
I'll answer any questions you or any of the planning commissioners may have on your
Ag Cultural Forestal District. Thank you. Any questions? Mr. Thomas?
Could it, this sounds like a dumb question, but I have to ask it anyhow.
Can they put solar farms and windmill farms in the agricultural and forestal district?
Yet I can. In our Ag of Forestal Districts, we do allow additional use permits in them.
If you recall, we've had some telecommunication towers during our Ag of Forestal Districts.
So we allow it to preserve the property for farming. I know that that has come up
through the couple of applications coming for this board for solar. So the property owners would
get a benefit, but the county would lose tax revenue. That's a tax action question. I cannot
answer. You need to talk to the commissioner, Reverend, on that. I think that's a valid question
for any future planning commission meeting when we have 800 or 900 acres coming in.
And we're going to lose tax revenue, but the developer is going to make big bucks on a solar farm.
I think the planning department should have an answer for that when we have the next
submittal comes in that requests a conditional use permit, because that's a significant tax loss.
We will take that out. I'll take that out consideration, Mr Thomas.
Mr. Chairman, if I might be able to also clarify that point, any such solar facility would have
the ability to be continued to be in an agricultural and forestal district. They would not have the
benefit of land use taxation. Again, the commissioner of revenue has a different way of approaching
that. And so the land use evaluation, they would have to address the rollback tax issue.
Pay those taxes and then be addressed appropriately, whatever the commissioner of
revenue would deem that be, with the solar facility itself. That generates additional taxation
opportunities for the county. And through the commissioner of revenue, the county does receive
tax revenue, if you will, from such solar facilities. But again, a solar facility or a
solar cell tower would be allowed to be within an agricultural and forestal district.
It would not qualify for agricultural land use taxation.
Thank you, Mr. Reddy. Any other questions? Mr. Mulder.
Got a question about the Reliance Road agricultural district in the parcel 92A18.
That is the Judy property. And if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Judy runs his business from that location,
keeps his equipment there. Am I correct? That would be a question from Mr. Chair.
I just know that Mr. Judy owns that. I don't know if he runs his business out of there.
Okay. Well, I know for a fact that the trucks come and go from there. So I was just curious
that that could be an agricultural district and still run a business from that location.
That concerns me that we're letting a business run on agricultural,
and it's not an agricultural business, but that just concerns me. I'll pull that, bring
that to your attention. Thanks, sir. Anymails?
Here are another discussion there. This is a public hearing. He wanted to come forward,
I'll open a public hearing at this time to speak to him for this matter.
He's in no one rushing up. I'll close the public hearing. Any further discussion?
Your staff? Here, no one. And I've got my ducks in a row here. I believe we're doing one motion
for all these districts. Is that correct? Even in addition to the new ones? Is that how we're
going to handle this? Or do I need to do two separate motions for the to add the two new ones? And
then go back to the other ones? Two separate motions, so you add the new ones in.
All right, so I need a motion for to include, and I'll take it that staff will address Mr.
Moldins concerns moving forward. We will. I left up the districts up there for you, Mr. Chairman.
I'll open it there. So do we want to do the two new ones first? I'll do the two new ones first.
I'll entertain a motion to add the back creek, the back mountain district and the reliance
district as there are two new districts to the agricultural for sterile district. So move to
have a second. Second, and I'll start down here with Mr. Moldin. Moldin, no.
Morrison, yes. Dawson, yes. Mo, no. Trap it, no. Thomas, no. All right, yes.
Arsden, yes. Julie, yes. Oh, yes. Chair votes, yes. So we think the majority ruled there with
the adding those two new districts to the ag and our for sterile district with the
duly noted on the reliance district. That will go to the board of supervisors on the 12th.
The next motion I'll entertain is to renew the remaining seven that we see up here on the board.
Our all been apple pie ris double church green spring red bud south rhetoric in south timber
rich to have a motion to renew those. We've got a motion. Second, and we've got a second. Mr. Oets.
Oets, yes. And Brody, yes. Julie, yes. Arsden, yes. Amen, yes. All right, yes.
Thomas, yes. Trap it, yes. Moldin, yes. Dawson, yes. Morrison, yes. Moldin, yes.
And Chair votes, yes. So that also will go with a payroll vote to the board supervisors on the 12th.
Thank you. And we have, we move on to our next item. Our next item is a draft update of the 2020,
2021 Frederick County Interstate and Primary Road Improvement Plan. And I see Mr. Bishop making
his way forward. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission. Just preliminary, as you
noted, this is a public hearing item as well. You are typically used to getting interstate
primary and secondary together. So just to clarify any confusion that may result from the fact that
you're only seeing interstate and primary this evening, that is solely due to the fact that the
secondary program is actually a programming document as well in cooperation with VDOT and they
are still in the midst of trying to update revenue projections. So right now, I do not have an
estimate on when they're going to be done. I was in a, in a virtual meeting this morning where I
asked that question again, in the stand district still has, has not gotten anything concrete. So
once those things come through, you'll see that as opposed to when you're used to seeing it, but
that will be coming. Moving on, we do have basic updates of your interstate and primary plans.
These are long well established plans and we only have so many interstates and primaries
in the community. So relatively, relatively brief. But if I may begin with the interstate
road improvement plan summary of changes, the first of those is a simple update to the language
on exit 317. The reason for that, frankly, was to make the language a little more general.
The reason I'm trying to make the language a little more general in the community agreed
is because we have multiple smart scale applications going forward for that interchange. The first
of which is a county application for the VDOT district grant program under smart scale. And it's
a smaller application that would realign that northbound exit ramp as well as improve turning lanes
under the interstate for northbound and southbound ramps. Some more modest application going
against a smaller pot of money in order to try and be competitive. Now those improvements
would certainly still have their impact, but they are not the ultimate solution if you will.
The other application that's going forward, still a county application would going forward
through the metropolitan planning organization in order to access this statewide high priority
funds through smart scale, which is a much larger pot of money. As such, it's a more aggressive
application in which we're seeking to do a interchange treatment called a diverging diamond.
I'm happy to speak more with anybody interested in that, but just that is why you see much more
general language for the exit 317 improvements than you did in the past to make sure there's no
conflict with either of those applications. The next change that you see regards the exit 307.
Previously, you had one dot, if you will, now you have a purple dot and a yellow dot.
And this is simply to clarify that while we do need improvements, frankly, in the nearer term
to the existing exit 307, it still emphasizes the desire long term for the relocated exit 307.
So you see that update. And that is the total of the changes from last year to the interstate
road improvement plan. Are there any questions on the interstate plan before I move on to primary?
Questions? Okay. On the primary road improvement plan, once again, just a simple update.
Anybody who travels 277 these days knows that we are finally moving to construction
on the first phase of the long desired improvements to 277. So simply put, we have removed what
previously was 3a. I'm sorry, yeah, 3a. From the plan and re-rank the rest of the 277 desired
improvements since that job has actually gotten a notice to proceed. You may recall and past
updates of a job has been funded but not necessarily constructed yet. We've kept it on there
because through long experience, we have sometimes seen things fall away. However, since the actual
notice to proceed and you see cones out there and everything else now barrels rather, I have a
high level of confidence that I don't have to worry about that. So we've gone ahead and clean that
up. I would further note that the committee, just as an informational item, the committee has
authorized me to go ahead and undergo a bit of a literature and research review
to look into priority setting practices and other communities and states just to make sure we're
still happy with how we're doing this. It's an interest item at this point. It's too soon to
say if it will go anywhere but that's just a discussion that's going to be taken place at the
transportation committee that I would just make you aware of. With that said, the committee did
review this item on July 27 and has recommended approval to the board. We are seeking a recommendation
from the planning commission as well and as we already know, it's public hearing.
I can miss you. Any questions? Concerns? I really don't want to ask this question but I can't
help myself. I'm sorry, Mark. The Route 37, is there a point where we as a county, as a community,
and maybe the transportation committee has done this? Is there a point where we look at that and
really think critically about the reality of whether that road, as it's been conceived and
envisioned and incorporated in our plans, is it viable? Is it something that is the cost just
going to continue to grow and grow and grow and we're going to continue to have it on our plans?
But it's been 30 years or so since the first public input session is about the whole thing and
it's just every year that I see it, I feel it. I feel it in my soul that I need to ask the question
and if we need to reimagine what this road is going to be. It's a very fair question as far
as the escalating cost. Of course, it's escalating and as a high cost item, you feel that even more
because all projects that go on built are escalating, of course, but when it's a high cost item,
it really knocks your socks off to see how much money we're talking about. That said, there's been
quite a bit of discussion at the staff level and sometimes with the individual developer level.
With the upcoming Comprehensive Plan update, I do expect that just maybe a good opportunity
to reinvigorate that conversation, but it's certainly something that's in the front of
front of our minds. Thank you. It's a public hearing. I'll open a public hearing for anyone
like to come forward. Speak to this matter. What's their thoughts? You know one. I'll close a public
hearing and there's no other further discussion from staff or for commissioners. I'll entertain a
motion. Do we need a motion to send us on to the board? So do I have a motion? Mr. Chairman,
I move that we send the 2020-2021 Frederick County Primary and Interstate Road Improvement Plan
to the Board of Supervisors with a positive recommendation. Second. Second. Yes.
And I will start. I mean, change up and try it with Miss Dawson. How about that? She said,
I don't want her to nod off on tonight. Is she here? Molyneus. Mr. Roots.
Oh, yes. And Bogey, yes. Julia's. Arshman, yes. Man, yes. Fine, yes.
Mr. Roots, yes. Mr. Roots, yes. Mr. Roots, yes. This goes for approval.
Goes to the Board of Supervisors. Also, I believe on the 12th of August.
Be busy day that day. Thank you for everyone. The next item is an information discussion item
on our agenda for daycare facilities. Mr. Clan. Yes. Good evening, Mr. Chairman. Members
of the Planning Commission, this is a proposed ordinance amendment to the zoning ordinance to expand
the county's definition for daycare facility to also include adult care. Our current
definition for daycare facility limits these types of services to only children.
I will note that this is a request from a local engineering firm on behalf of their client
to amend the ordinance. An amendment to the definition is proposed as follows that for a daycare
facility, it be a facility in which five children and or adults, not including persons who are
related by blood, marriage, or adoption to the people who maintain the facility, are received
for care, protection, and guidance during only part of a 24-hour day. The proposed amendment
would not change which zoning districts these types of facilities are allowed in either by right
or with an approved conditional use permit. The Development Review and Regulations Committee
reviewed this ordinance amendment request on June 25th and generally supported the
proposed amendment to expand the definition of daycare facilities to include adult care.
DRC highlighted a gap with this type of service within the community for the care of elderly
and or disabled adults during the work week. The item is presented to you all this evening for
information discussion in any comments from the Planning Commission will be forward to the Board
of Supervisors. Thank you. Mr. Clan, discussion, members, Mr. Thomas, certainly we have a need
any county for adult care facilities. I'm a little concerned or shouldn't we just have a
separate ordinance or separate paragraph for adult care facilities because the
facility conditions and everything I would think have to be significantly different than a
child care facility. I'm sure the state has a licensing, well I don't I shouldn't say I'm sure.
I assume the state has a licensing process for an adult care facility similar to a daycare
facility but the requirements for restrooms for safety areas for handicapped conditions for an
adult are significantly different than for a child. So where would those conditions be covered
if we just lump it in with a child care facility? We don't have any supplemental uses for child
care facilities so it's just the definition and the either in the use or in ordinance. All the
other requirements for those types of facilities are handled as you stated by the state. They do
have requirements for child care facilities and they also have requirements, similar requirements
for adult care facilities. Obviously individual uses may be required a conditional use permit so
conditions could be assigned by the county and they would certainly need to meet all the
building care requirements when they applied for a site plan and that those would enter
you know the type of restrooms, kitchen facilities, access those type of things.
Make it extremely obvious to people sometimes we assume things that maybe we shouldn't assume.
Should we put a statement in here that they have to comply with all
building code requirements and state requirements for an adult care facility?
Well when you are required to establish a use you have to set up you have to do a site plan
through the county so all those requirements would be met through that process but certainly if
it's a recommendation of the planning commission we can certainly include that as part of the definition.
I would like to see us put a little more thought into the adult care part because
you know I'm not sure in child care facilities you probably don't need
defibrillators but in an adult care facility you probably should have some things like that
and other specific requirements and I just think we ought to remind or point it out that
they have to meet the state requirements so that people recognize that you know I have a child
care facility so I can just convert over to a day care or an adult care facility.
Hopefully people won't think that but you know I think they are significantly different
should be treated differently or separately. Certainly give me those comments thank you.
What else is Mr. Rhodes? I don't know if I can go along with that Roger or
items for adult care since we don't do it for child care because generally when we get this
in as a CUP that's one of the first conditions you have to comply with the state.
So if we add in supplemental standards they're going to be chasing every year if the state
is changing their requirements to make sure we don't conflict. Why don't I add in supplemental
standards? I just want to make it very clear that they have to meet the state standards.
Right but that's always like the number one condition. I know we always put that in there but
that doesn't mean people always read it. The only question I had is since we're adding it to
this definition would all the CUP's for child care that's been adopted up till today all of
them act we'd be able to do adult care now since we just changed the overall definition.
I know they would be under they put they were approved for prior to the change in the definition.
Okay. When they came in for a conditional use permit they would have to specify day care
or adult care. Child care or adult care. Correct. And on those conditions of a previously
approved we typically condition the number of children that are allowed so it's very clear that
it's children X amounts that are allowed with those types of facilities.
Question just one question. So really what this is doing is clarifying that from a land use
perspective where day care centers are permitted for children we effectively think those are
the same locations that are appropriate for an adult care center generally. I mean you subject
to CUP or whatever. Generally yes that is the intent. Okay. And how is that like today if someone
is the issue that if you were to want to propose such a use that we don't have a use in the
ordinance that allows for it or that is correct in the engineer that put forth the request as a
client that's interested in doing adult care. And we spoke with the zoning administrator and
there's no other mechanism in the ordinance short of changing the definition of day care facility
that would allow us to establish that use. Thank you.
I think you've got a lot of discussion that took place and I think you've got some good points
to take back to the board and I think that's good so you'll go to you'll take those on back on the
12th also. Okay thank you. All right keep moving forward here the other we the investor something
else I do know we make some announcements real quick under other we have a joint session on the
12th of August next Wednesday at 530 with the board of supervisors this planning commission
and the board supervisors and so and I think the the call tonight that the food will be served at
five o'clock so keep that in mind. Our next meeting of this planning commission we have known
for the 19th of the month so we'll have one two weeks hence from now and that's all I have under
other unless I'm looking to work my secretary and he's saying no. You're covered all of the
bases thank you. All right I'll do a motion to entertain a motion to adjourn.
Mr. Chairman I move that we adjourn. All those in favor. All right we're adjourn.
